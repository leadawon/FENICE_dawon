    "document": "Sure, St Andrews is the home of golf and Monaco hosts the most glamorous race on the Formula One circuit, but the sporting world offers so much more than what can be seen on television. With the warmer months upon us the countdown is on for all manner of festivals around the globe, with many of them revolving around intriguing, entertaining and downright wacky events. MailOnline Travel sheds some light on the most unique sporting escapes you could take this year as a spectator or in some cases even as a participant, from the historic cheese-rolling race in Gloucestershire to the Mud Olympics\u00a0in Brunsbuettel, Germany. Scroll down for video . The 20th annual Wife Carrying World Championships will be held on July 3 and 4 in Sonkaj\u00e4rvi, Finland . WIFE CARRYING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS: SONKAJARVI, FINLAND . While it doesn't exactly fly the flag for sexual equality, the annual Wife Carrying World Championships\u00a0certainly appears to be a fun couple of days in Sonkaj\u00e4rvi, Finland. Since 1994 couples from around the world have converged on the town of about 4,000 people that without the event would be famous for having more than 200 lakes in the area. The 20th edition will be held this year over July 3 and 4 and be another carnival-like affair with, of course, the wife carrying as the main event but also including markets and a fiercely contested karaoke competition. In wife carrying, a man must carry a woman weighing at least 108lbs (if she is less than this she has to wear weights) around a 830ft sand track with tricky obstacles to contend with. While it sounds like a pub dare that's simply gone too far, the event has roots in the late 19th century when the leader of a local gang called Rosvo-Ronkainen tested potential recruits on a tough obstacle course - it wasn't uncommon for the men to steal women from nearby towns. A wheel of cheese speeds away from its chasers on the steep slope of Cooper's Hill near Brockworth . CHEESE-ROLLING RACE: BROCKWORTH, GLOUCESTERSHIRE . Every year a wheel of cheese is rolled down the steep slope of Cooper's Hill on the outskirts of the village of Brockworth and is followed by a bunch of people risking life and limb to catch it. Given the cheese can reach speeds of up to 70mph, the chase is a futile expedition but a spectacularly bizarre spectacle for onlookers who come from all over the world to compete or watch. The winner is the first to cross a line at the bottom. The local council wants nothing to do with the race, its most famous attraction, due to concerns over safety and insurance, but it goes on each year regardless. Injuries are inevitable in the race that has taken place since the 15th century on the Gloucestershire hill .

Other events include the throwing of a massive stone, weight throwing contests judges on either distance or height and the sheaf toss in which a pitchfork is used to throw a heavy clump of straw over a bar.

The Welsh town of Llanwrtyd Wells is famed for its wacky events, with the bog swimming on August 30 preceded this year by the Welsh Open Stone Skimming Championships on May 24 and The Whole Earth Man vs Horse Marathon on June 13. Hundreds compete in the bog snorkelling with participants last year alone coming from France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Hong Kong and Mali.

A competitor in the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel plays handball in the mud flats of the River Elbe . A women feels the cold of a hose as competitors attempt to wash away the mud after a day of competition . MUD OLYMPICS: BRUNSBUETTEL, GERMANY . It\u2019s hot, sticky and awesome at the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel, near Hamburg in northern Germany, where the annual event is held on the mud flats of the River Elbe. Known in German as Wattoluempiade (Tideland Olympics), the Games feature hundreds of competitors not afraid to get down and dirty as they compete in filthy versions of handball, volleyball, football and tug of war, and more. The event is so popular that the places for most of the sports for this year's games on July 11 were booked out within 50 seconds of entries opening, so it's as exclusive as it is dirty. Each year Wattoluempiade raises money for the region's cancer sufferers and in total since 2004 it has brought in more than \u20ac250,000. Camel wrestling has taken place in Turkey for more than 2,000 years and attracts crowds of more than 20,000 . CAMEL WRESTLING: SELCUK, TURKEY . Not for everyone, in particular animal welfare groups who oppose it, or the feint of heart but certainly historic - camel wrestling has been going on in Turkey for more than 2,000 years. More than 20,000 people gather for the 20,000 people will gather again for the annual Selcuk Efes Camel Wrestling Festival in January, which has run in its current form by Turkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism since 1984. The Tulu camels are bred especially for wrestling and much like their human boxing counterparts are matched based on their age and weight to ensure a fair fight. What compels the competing male camels to fight? A female camel of course, which is why the main in Selcuk in Turkey\u2019s south coincides with mating season. A prisoner is bucked off a bull in front of a packed stadium at the Angola Rodeo at Louisiana State Penitentiary . PRISON RODEO: LOUISIANA, USA . This is precisely what it says on the packet - a rodeo in which prisoners are the stars of the show. And it's a far bigger industry and a better spectacle than you\u2019d expect. Prison rodeos are held throughout the United States but the oldest of its kind is the Angola Rodeo held at Louisiana State Penitentiary, which has been going strong since 1965. Spectators can buy tickets and attend like any other sporting event, only they\u2019re in a jail so restrictions such as not being allowed to carry weapons apply. When the spring rodeo is held on the weekend of April 18 and 19, bull riding will as always be the main event, but some visitors come especially for the arts and crafts market. And yes, the goods are made by the prisoners. A bizarre even among the bucking broncos and barrel races is convict poker, which features four prisoners playing poker while an angry bull runs around the arena, sometimes with painful results. Funds raised by the rodeo go back into the running of the rodeo and into the Inmate Welfare Fund, which provides inmates with educational and recreational supplies. Naadam festivals take place throughout Mongolia, with the biggest here in Ulaanbaatar . NAADAM: ULAANBAATAR, MONGOLIA . The 'manly' sports of Mongolia are celebrated at this ancient festival held all over the country from July 11 to 13 and all-comers, including tourists, are welcome as competitors or spectators. The festival's full name is 'eriin gurvan naadam', meaning 'the three games of men', which are wrestling, horse riding and archery. And despite it being very much a traditional games, it's moving with the times and women can now compete in all but the wrestling. In 2010, Naadam was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO and a host of travel companies offer guided tours. Gregor Edmunds competes in the caber toss (left) and weight over a bar at Cowal Highland Gathering . HIGHLAND GAMES: DUNOON, SCOTLAND . As Scottish as whisky and haggis, Highland Games are held throughout the country from May to September with as many as 60 sports contested. The biggest of them all is the Cowal Highland Gathering over the last weekend in August which has been going in Dunoon since way back in 1894. Among the most popular events is the caber toss which sees massive guys in kilts throwing a giant log in the air and trying to get the top of it to land nearest to them - they say it originates from when such a technique was used to create bridge crossings over waterways. Other events include the throwing of a massive stone, weight throwing contests judges on either distance or height and the sheaf toss in which a pitchfork is used to throw a heavy clump of straw over a bar. Pipe bands and Highland dancing competitions along with local food and general frivolity are also important parts of such festivals. Entry to the three days of the Snow Polo World Cup in St Moritz is free, but it's not exactly cheap . SNOW POLO: ST MORITZ, SWITZERLAND . One of the great strengths of sports is their all-inclusive ability to bring different walks of life together on a level playing field - you wouldn't think snow polo is one of those though. However, since the  Snow Polo World Cup has been held in St Moritz it's be a free event for spectators keen to watch from the stands or the edge of the field. This doesn't include accommodation at the relatively pricey resort, or food, or the inevitable champagne that would seem appropriate at such an affair.\u00a0VIP tickets are also available for sit-down lunches and other perks. Still, more than 12,000 people watched the 2015 edition of the cup in January and more are expected for the 2016 event from January 29 to 31. The event has been held here since 1985 as teams gather from around the globe to play on the idyllic frozen lake for the Cartier Trophy. With snow-capped mountains of the Engadin Valley as the back drop and all manner of accompanying events, the pricey hotels of the ski resort region are also packed at this time so book well ahead.",

    "document": "Sure, St Andrews is the home of golf and Monaco hosts the most glamorous race on the Formula One circuit, but the sporting world offers so much more than what can be seen on television. With the warmer months upon us the countdown is on for all manner of festivals around the globe, with many of them revolving around intriguing, entertaining and downright wacky events. MailOnline Travel sheds some light on the most unique sporting escapes you could take this year as a spectator or in some cases even as a participant, from the historic cheese-rolling race in Gloucestershire to the Mud Olympics\u00a0in Brunsbuettel, Germany. Scroll down for video . The 20th annual Wife Carrying World Championships will be held on July 3 and 4 in Sonkaj\u00e4rvi, Finland . WIFE CARRYING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS: SONKAJARVI, FINLAND . While it doesn't exactly fly the flag for sexual equality, the annual Wife Carrying World Championships\u00a0certainly appears to be a fun couple of days in Sonkaj\u00e4rvi, Finland. Since 1994 couples from around the world have converged on the town of about 4,000 people that without the event would be famous for having more than 200 lakes in the area. The 20th edition will be held this year over July 3 and 4 and be another carnival-like affair with, of course, the wife carrying as the main event but also including markets and a fiercely contested karaoke competition. In wife carrying, a man must carry a woman weighing at least 108lbs (if she is less than this she has to wear weights) around a 830ft sand track with tricky obstacles to contend with. While it sounds like a pub dare that's simply gone too far, the event has roots in the late 19th century when the leader of a local gang called Rosvo-Ronkainen tested potential recruits on a tough obstacle course - it wasn't uncommon for the men to steal women from nearby towns. A wheel of cheese speeds away from its chasers on the steep slope of Cooper's Hill near Brockworth . CHEESE-ROLLING RACE: BROCKWORTH, GLOUCESTERSHIRE . Every year a wheel of cheese is rolled down the steep slope of Cooper's Hill on the outskirts of the village of Brockworth and is followed by a bunch of people risking life and limb to catch it. Given the cheese can reach speeds of up to 70mph, the chase is a futile expedition but a spectacularly bizarre spectacle for onlookers who come from all over the world to compete or watch. The winner is the first to cross a line at the bottom. The local council wants nothing to do with the race, its most famous attraction, due to concerns over safety and insurance, but it goes on each year regardless. Injuries are inevitable in the race that has taken place since the 15th century on the Gloucestershire hill . While its origin is disputed, rolling down the hill after the cheese wheel dates back as far as the 15th century and has been much the same since. Although in recent years the local cheese supplier was told not to offer up the customary wheel of Double Gloucester but authorities, a Dutch equivalent stepped in. To see it in action this year head to Cooper\u2019s Hill for midday on the late spring bank holiday, which this year falls on May 25.

France's ruling Socialists under Francois Hollande (pictured) suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections last night - as three years of left-wing rule was branded a 'massive failure' Even the Correze department - Mr Hollande's home turf in the south west - was won by the UMP.

Former president Mr Sarkozy said: 'Tonight, the Republican right, and the centre, has won the departmental elections.' Referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments.' Mr Sarkozy said 'three years' under the most outdated Socialist party in Europe had brought the country to its knees, and the electorate had had enough. Exit polls showed the opposition UMP party under Nicolas Sarkozy (pictured) controlling up to 70 departments, compared to 37 for the Socialists . 'A new era is starting. Hope is reborn for France,' said Mr Sarkozy. 'The road will be long and hard, but change is coming and nothing can stop it.' Also highlighting the 'failure' of the Socialists, was the far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen. Although the FN was expected to win up to one department maximum, they were on course to win more than 200 seats on regional councils. Calling on Manuel Valls, the Socialist Prime Minister, 'to resign', Ms Le Pen said her anti-immigration and anti-Europe party had a huge part to play in the future of France. Manuel Valls, the Socialist Prime Minister, conceded 'incontestable' electoral defeat soon after the polls closed at 8pm. Far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen (pictured) also highlighted the 'failure' of the Socialists . Noting increased extremism in his country, Mr Valls said: 'Far-right gains in local elections are a sign of lasting change in the French political system'. The election will choose 4,108 local councillors and - crucially - shape the political landscape in the run-up to the 2017 presidential race. The vote was also a key test for Mr Sarkozy who, despite a series of corruption scandals, is convinced he can return to power in two years' time. According to the exit polls, the UMP and its centrist allies could end up with nearly twice as many seats as President Hollande's Socialists.. Yesterday represented the Socialists' third political battering in a year - they were roundly beaten in municipal and European elections last May.",

    "document": "New pictures have been released revealing the ordeal of Brazil's Miss BumBum runner-up\u00a0Andressa Urach who was\u00a0hospitalised at the weekend after her buttock implants became infected. Andressa Urach, 27, had to have toxic substances drained from her body after her bottom fillers 'rotted', triggering a life-threatening infection. The model admitted she brought her health woes on herself after 'my vanity made me push the limits.' Andressa Urach is pictured in hospital this week having life-saving treatment after her buttock implants triggered an infection . The model had to have a combination of Pmma and hydrogel removed from her body . Speaking from her hospital bed in Sao Paulo earlier this week, Miss Urach revealed that she has undergone an emergency operation to remove the substances from her left butt cheek. Without medical intervention, the infection could have been fatal. She is now recovering after having a a combination of Pmma and hydrogel removed from her body. New pictures have been released of her during and after this unpleasant procedure as she hopes other women will learn from her experience and avoid having surgery in the pursuit of\u00a0perfection. Andressa was first hospitalised last year thanks to cosmetic procedures going wrong . 'I am suffering a lot, but God is with me. It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits,' the mother-of-one admitted earlier this week. Despite making a living off her\u00a0voluminous\u00a0bottom, she said she's now happy to have a less\u00a0curvaceous\u00a0rear if it\u00a0means she can survive. She said: 'Thanks to God I no longer need my body to work, now I work with honour and can sustain my family like that. I prefer to have legs and be able to walk and lose half a buttock than to die.' Of her hospital stay she admitted: 'It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits' Her voluminous rear used to be her most prized asset but now she said she'd rather it's smaller if it means she'll be healthier . Earlier today, the reality TV posted a picture of herself on Instagram recovering\u00a0in her\u00a0hospital\u00a0bed with her hands making\u00a0a\u00a0heart sign as she thanked fans for their support and get well wishes. 'Small gestures of affection make a difference! In the most difficult moments of our lives, we can see who really are our friends,' she wrote. Prior to her brush with death, Miss Urach - who once made hotly-contested claims that she slept with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - had been an\u00a0advocate\u00a0of cosmetic\u00a0surgery. She had reportedly undergone at least nine cosmetic procedures in the past five years. They were said to have included a nose job, a bioplasty facial 'correction', jaw reduction, breast enlargement, liposuction and even vaginal lip reduction. Most important of all was her prized rear. It won her the runner-up title in the 2012 Miss BumBum contest, which aims to find Brazil's most attractive bottom. She reportedly had injections of two filers, hydrogel and PMMA, to make it larger and more plump. But in July she began complaining of discomfort and had 400ml of hydrogel drained from each of her upper thighs. She told Brazil's R7 website at the time: 'The hydrogel was not absorbed by my body and started to harm me. 'Now I've discovered that the PMMA is sticking to my muscles and causing the tissue to rot. Despite the operation, she continued to be in pain and in November she was taken to the Conceicao Hospital in Porto Alegre with an advanced infection of her left leg. The model pictured earlier this month during an interview with Dailymail.com after her legs were infected . Andressa, a runner up in Brazil's Miss BumBum competition, has revealed the terrible damage wreaked on her body by plastic surgery after wounds in her thigh were infected . She spent a month in intensive care and reportedly feared she would lose her leg . This graphic photos show gaping holes in Andressa's thighs, all in the name of beauty . She underwent two unsuccessful drainage procedures, according to reports, before suffering from septic shock and being moved to intensive care. At one point her life was in danger and it was claimed her leg could have had to be amputated. After making a recovery from that incident, she was then rushed back to hospital last weekend with another infection cause by her buttock implants. She underwent another emergency operation to remove a combination of Pmma and hydrogel and is now being treated with antibiotics through a catheter and will soon begin physiotherapy. Miss Urach hit headlines around the world after claiming she had had an affair with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, a claim the Real Madrid striker strenuously denied. Andressa featured in the Miss BumBum contest in 2012 and claimed she slept with Cristiano Ronaldo . Pain: Miss Urach when her legs began hurting last year (left) and, right, in better spirits in her hospital bed . She said the footballer slept with her in a hotel just 48 hours before a Champions League semi final which his team lost 4-1 to German side Borussia Dortmund. The Portuguese winger, 29, took to his Facebook page to say he was 'deeply outraged.' He accused Andressa of 'pure fiction and forgery' and 'seeking the limelight on my account' and insisted he was at the Madrid hotel where she claimed they made love for a media interview. Brazil overtook the U.S. in 2013 to become the most prolific plastic surgery nation in the world. Almost 1.5million procedures were performed in the South American country - an increase of 600,000 in just two years. These included 226,000 breast enlargements and 64,000 buttock augmentations, a fifth of all those in the world. Brazil has more than 5,000 plastic surgeons who also performed 78,000 facelifts, 77,000 nose jobs and 219 penis enlargements, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. But the U.S. was still far ahead for the number of non-surgical procedures, such as laser hair removal and chemical peels, with 2.5million to Brazil's 650,000. Fellow Miss BumBum contestant Jessica Lopes, who shared a flat with Ms Urach, said last year: 'Andressa and I would go to the plastic surgeon as if we were going shopping. 'Sometimes we would agree to do some procedure together, we were not afraid. 'We were slaves to beauty.'",

She said the footballer slept with her in a hotel just 48 hours before a Champions League semi final which his team lost 4-1 to German side Borussia Dortmund. The Portuguese winger, 29, took to his Facebook page to say he was 'deeply outraged.' He accused Andressa of 'pure fiction and forgery' and 'seeking the limelight on my account' and insisted he was at the Madrid hotel where she claimed they made love for a media interview. Brazil overtook the U.S. in 2013 to become the most prolific plastic surgery nation in the world. Almost 1.5million procedures were performed in the South American country - an increase of 600,000 in just two years. These included 226,000 breast enlargements and 64,000 buttock augmentations, a fifth of all those in the world. Brazil has more than 5,000 plastic surgeons who also performed 78,000 facelifts, 77,000 nose jobs and 219 penis enlargements, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. But the U.S. was still far ahead for the number of non-surgical procedures, such as laser hair removal and chemical peels, with 2.5million to Brazil's 650,000. Fellow Miss BumBum contestant Jessica Lopes, who shared a flat with Ms Urach, said last year: 'Andressa and I would go to the plastic surgeon as if we were going shopping.

    "document": "New pictures have been released revealing the ordeal of Brazil's Miss BumBum runner-up\u00a0Andressa Urach who was\u00a0hospitalised at the weekend after her buttock implants became infected. Andressa Urach, 27, had to have toxic substances drained from her body after her bottom fillers 'rotted', triggering a life-threatening infection. The model admitted she brought her health woes on herself after 'my vanity made me push the limits.' Andressa Urach is pictured in hospital this week having life-saving treatment after her buttock implants triggered an infection . The model had to have a combination of Pmma and hydrogel removed from her body . Speaking from her hospital bed in Sao Paulo earlier this week, Miss Urach revealed that she has undergone an emergency operation to remove the substances from her left butt cheek. Without medical intervention, the infection could have been fatal. She is now recovering after having a a combination of Pmma and hydrogel removed from her body. New pictures have been released of her during and after this unpleasant procedure as she hopes other women will learn from her experience and avoid having surgery in the pursuit of\u00a0perfection. Andressa was first hospitalised last year thanks to cosmetic procedures going wrong . 'I am suffering a lot, but God is with me. It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits,' the mother-of-one admitted earlier this week. Despite making a living off her\u00a0voluminous\u00a0bottom, she said she's now happy to have a less\u00a0curvaceous\u00a0rear if it\u00a0means she can survive. She said: 'Thanks to God I no longer need my body to work, now I work with honour and can sustain my family like that. I prefer to have legs and be able to walk and lose half a buttock than to die.' Of her hospital stay she admitted: 'It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits' Her voluminous rear used to be her most prized asset but now she said she'd rather it's smaller if it means she'll be healthier . Earlier today, the reality TV posted a picture of herself on Instagram recovering\u00a0in her\u00a0hospital\u00a0bed with her hands making\u00a0a\u00a0heart sign as she thanked fans for their support and get well wishes. 'Small gestures of affection make a difference! In the most difficult moments of our lives, we can see who really are our friends,' she wrote. Prior to her brush with death, Miss Urach - who once made hotly-contested claims that she slept with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - had been an\u00a0advocate\u00a0of cosmetic\u00a0surgery. She had reportedly undergone at least nine cosmetic procedures in the past five years. They were said to have included a nose job, a bioplasty facial 'correction', jaw reduction, breast enlargement, liposuction and even vaginal lip reduction. Most important of all was her prized rear. It won her the runner-up title in the 2012 Miss BumBum contest, which aims to find Brazil's most attractive bottom. She reportedly had injections of two filers, hydrogel and PMMA, to make it larger and more plump. But in July she began complaining of discomfort and had 400ml of hydrogel drained from each of her upper thighs. She told Brazil's R7 website at the time: 'The hydrogel was not absorbed by my body and started to harm me. 'Now I've discovered that the PMMA is sticking to my muscles and causing the tissue to rot.

    "document": "Scotland Yard detectives swooped on the family home of Field Marshall Lord Bramall of Bushfield, the former chief of the defence staff and a D-Day veteran . Former defence chief Lord Bramall today dismissed any suggestion of his involvement in child abuse as 'absolutely a load of rubbish'. The ex-Chief of Defence Staff said he was 'mystified' about why the police had searched his home in Surrey. Detectives from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Midland have also raided the homes of Tory grandee Leon Brittan and former MP Harvey Proctor. Operation Midland is investigating claims boys senior members of the Establishment abused young men and boys in London and the south of England in the 1970s and 1980s. It includes claims that sex parties involving boys below the age of consent were held at the exclusive Dolphin Square apartment block near the Houses of Parliament. The operation includes detectives from the child abuse investigation command and the homicide and major crime command. It is also examining allegations three young men were murdered, . At 91, Lord Bramall \u2013 the latest VIP to be dragged into the sex abuse inquiry \u2013 is the oldest and most respected of Britain's eight living Field Marshals. He stepped down as Chief of Defence Staff in 1985 after four decades spent climbing the ranks from 2nd Lieutenant right to the pinnacle of Britain's armed forces. Officers from Operation Midland searched his home last Wednesday. He told the BBC: 'Categorically, never have I had a connection or anything to do with the matters being investigated. It is not in my character or my psyche.' He said: 'I know I have only had sex with someone other than my own sex.' He added that any suggestion he was involved in child abuse was 'absolutely a load of rubbish'. He said he had been to events at Dolphin Square 'four or fives times' but only once went into an\u00a0apartment\u00a0there. He has not been arrested, named as a suspect by police or questioned. Lord Bramall first saw action on the Normandy beaches the day after D-Day, when he was shelled. Everyone else in his vehicle died but he managed to crawl out. At first he thought he was on fire, but in fact he was badly wounded and was sent back to Britain for treatment. Lord Bramall returned to his unit just five weeks later and was leading a patrol on the Dutch-Belgian border when he was ambushed. Rather than flee, he led a counter-attack, and managed to wound two Germans and take another one captive. He was later awarded the Military Cross for his actions by Field Marshal Montgomery himself. He led the Royal Green Jackets in Borneo in 1965, commanded British forces in Hong Kong in the 1970s and was made head of the Army in 1979. Lord Bramall held that role during the Falklands War of 1982, and was a strong admirer of Margaret Thatcher. 'A wonderful war leader,' he said, 'probably even better than Churchill'. He married his wife Avril in 1949 and they have two children. The couple are still together. After he retired, festooned with decorations, he became a life peer \u2013 and has never been afraid to speak his mind in the Lords \u2013 opposing the second war in Iraq and what he termed 'mission creep' in Afghanistan. More recently, Lord Bramall has also been a vocal critic of defence cuts, which he fears could weaken the Army. He told peers that when it comes to dealing with threats you 'have to prepare for the unexpected'. Harvey Proctor insisted he was a 'discreet' man and had never been part of 'any rent boy ring' with Cabinet ministers, MPs or military top brass . The search of Lord Bramall's home took place on the same day as officers searched the Leicestershire home of ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor, 68, prompting him to publicly deny any wrongdoing. Proctor, whose Parliamentary career ended in a rent boy 'spanking' scandal, said he was trapped in a 'Kafka-esque fantasy'. More than 1,000 people have been questioned by police investigating claims of historic sex abuse. The huge number, including suspects, victims and witnesses, lays bare the scale of the task facing detectives. Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted the wave of allegations is consuming a huge amount of resources. But he pledged to get to the heart of the claims, no matter who was involved. Speaking on LBC Radio, Sir Bernard said his staff were 'determinedly working their way through' all the evidence, adding: 'We've now interviewed at least 1,000 people.' Asked whether the huge amount of resources required could be justified, he said victims deserve answers. 'What we cannot do is ignore people who were ignored 30 years ago,' he said. Sir Bernard added that police 'have to prioritise' but nevertheless have 'put tens of officers into these inquiries'. He said: 'We have got both witnesses and suspects that are scattered to the four winds. They are not grouped geographically like they were 30 years ago. 'But we will get to the bottom of it, I am sure we will, so far as it is possible.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

At 91, Lord Bramall \u2013 the latest VIP to be dragged into the sex abuse inquiry \u2013 is the oldest and most respected of Britain's eight living Field Marshals. He stepped down as Chief of Defence Staff in 1985 after four decades spent climbing the ranks from 2nd Lieutenant right to the pinnacle of Britain's armed forces. Officers from Operation Midland searched his home last Wednesday. He told the BBC: 'Categorically, never have I had a connection or anything to do with the matters being investigated. It is not in my character or my psyche.' He said: 'I know I have only had sex with someone other than my own sex.' He added that any suggestion he was involved in child abuse was 'absolutely a load of rubbish'. He said he had been to events at Dolphin Square 'four or fives times' but only once went into an\u00a0apartment\u00a0there. He has not been arrested, named as a suspect by police or questioned. Lord Bramall first saw action on the Normandy beaches the day after D-Day, when he was shelled. Everyone else in his vehicle died but he managed to crawl out. At first he thought he was on fire, but in fact he was badly wounded and was sent back to Britain for treatment. Lord Bramall returned to his unit just five weeks later and was leading a patrol on the Dutch-Belgian border when he was ambushed. Rather than flee, he led a counter-attack, and managed to wound two Germans and take another one captive. He was later awarded the Military Cross for his actions by Field Marshal Montgomery himself. He led the Royal Green Jackets in Borneo in 1965, commanded British forces in Hong Kong in the 1970s and was made head of the Army in 1979. Lord Bramall held that role during the Falklands War of 1982, and was a strong admirer of Margaret Thatcher. 'A wonderful war leader,' he said, 'probably even better than Churchill'. He married his wife Avril in 1949 and they have two children. The couple are still together. After he retired, festooned with decorations, he became a life peer \u2013 and has never been afraid to speak his mind in the Lords \u2013 opposing the second war in Iraq and what he termed 'mission creep' in Afghanistan. More recently, Lord Bramall has also been a vocal critic of defence cuts, which he fears could weaken the Army. He told peers that when it comes to dealing with threats you 'have to prepare for the unexpected'. Harvey Proctor insisted he was a 'discreet' man and had never been part of 'any rent boy ring' with Cabinet ministers, MPs or military top brass . The search of Lord Bramall's home took place on the same day as officers searched the Leicestershire home of ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor, 68, prompting him to publicly deny any wrongdoing. Proctor, whose Parliamentary career ended in a rent boy 'spanking' scandal, said he was trapped in a 'Kafka-esque fantasy'. More than 1,000 people have been questioned by police investigating claims of historic sex abuse. The huge number, including suspects, victims and witnesses, lays bare the scale of the task facing detectives. Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted the wave of allegations is consuming a huge amount of resources. But he pledged to get to the heart of the claims, no matter who was involved. Speaking on LBC Radio, Sir Bernard said his staff were 'determinedly working their way through' all the evidence, adding: 'We've now interviewed at least 1,000 people.' Asked whether the huge amount of resources required could be justified, he said victims deserve answers. 'What we cannot do is ignore people who were ignored 30 years ago,' he said. Sir Bernard added that police 'have to prioritise' but nevertheless have 'put tens of officers into these inquiries'. He said: 'We have got both witnesses and suspects that are scattered to the four winds. They are not grouped geographically like they were 30 years ago. 'But we will get to the bottom of it, I am sure we will, so far as it is possible.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",
    "summary": "the ex-chief of defence staff said he was 'mystified' about why the police had searched his. detectives have also raided the homes of tory grandee leon brittan and harvey proctor. operation midland is investigating claims boys senior members of the establishment. it includes claims that sex parties involving boys below the age of consent were held at the exclusive dolphin square apartment block. scotland yard detectives swooped on family home of field marshall lord."

It was goal number 20 for Bale in a season that has been judged underwhelming in Spain.

It was route one stuff. Wayne Hennessey pumped the ball long and Israel allowed it to bounce. Bale stole above Tibi to nod into the path of Ramsey, who delivered a brilliant header over Marciano.

It was route one stuff. Wayne Hennessey pumped the ball long and Israel allowed it to bounce. Bale stole above Tibi to nod into the path of Ramsey, who delivered a brilliant header over Marciano. Ramsey celebrated by running to the 900 Wales fans and pointing to the skies, his grandmother having died last week. Bale dedicated the win to much-loved kitman Dai Williams, who passed away last month with the players wearing black armbands. By the end, Wales were running through 10-man Israel at will, Tibi having been sent off for a second booking shortly after 2-0 for fouling Bale again. Substitute Sam Vokes, making his first international appearance in a year following serious injury, nearly scored, as Bale twice went close to getting his hat-trick. Israel are no mugs. Their 3-0 win over Bosnia here in November and perfect record prior to this game, is indication of that. But they were made to look woefully short by Wales. Bale said: \u2018We\u2019re in a good position now and we\u2019ve got a chance of qualifying.

    "document": "Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be given to Wales is that this cauldron of noise, which at kick-off seemed so threatening, was reduced to a quiet hum after the 50th minute. That was the moment when Gareth Bale reminded us why Real Madrid paid \u00a386million for his signature, why the caustic treatment of his recent performances in Spain seems so odd. Having drawn a foul from Eytan Tibi inches outside the box with his pace, he dispatched the ball into the net as simply as if from the penalty spot in any. His shot curled over the wall with surgical placement, leaving goalkeeper Ofir Marciano stock still. It was pure quality. Gareth Bale scored twice as Wales beat Israel in Haifa on Saturday in Euro 2016 qualifying . Bale (second left) lashes in his second goal of the game for Wales against Israel . Bale celebrates as his team moved to the top of Group B with victory in Haifa over Israel . Bale (centre) leads the celebrations after his second half free kick put Wales 2-0 up against rivals Israel . Bale (third right) uploaded a picture to Instagram afterwards with the caption 'what a performance from the lads' Israel (4-3-3):\u00a0Marciano 6; Dgani 5.5, Ben Haim I 5.5, Tibi 3, Ben Harush 6; Yeini 5, Natcho 5, Refaelov 5; Ben Haim II 5 (Biton 60\u2019 5), Zahavi 6 (Sahar 71\u2019 5), Damari 4 (Hemed 44\u2019 5) Booked: Refaelov . Sent off: Tibi . Manager: Eli Guttman 5 . Wales (5-3-1-1): Hennessey 6; Gunter 6, Collins 6, Williams 7, Davies 7, Taylor 7; Ramsey 7.5 (MacDonald 86\u2019), Allen 7, Ledley 6.5 (Vaughan 48\u2019 6); Bale 8; Robson-Kanu 6.5 (Vokes 69\u2019 6.5) Manager: Chris Coleman 7 . Referee: Milorad Mazic 7 . MoM: Bale . His rapturous celebration spoke of the goal\u2019s personal significance and collective importance. He answered his critics without uttering a word and made certain a momentous victory in Welsh ambitions to reach Euro 2016. It was his 15th goal in 49 caps for Wales, moving him level with John Charles in the all-time scorers chart. He went past the great man 13 minutes from the end to rubber stamp Wales\u2019s ascension to top of Group B at the halfway stage on 11 points and within sight of a first major tournament since 1958. Aaron Ramsey provided the assist, seizing possession on the left and cutting back for Bale to finish into the corner.

    "document": "A petty feud between the two most powerful women in Ed Miliband\u2019s inner circle has rocked the Labour Party. The dispute between the party\u2019s Election chief Lucy Powell and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton flared up over an invitation to the Brit pop music awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote. Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair \u2013 both rivals for Miliband\u2019s ear \u2013 to a head. Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell \u2013 who is tipped as a future Labour leader \u2013 to attend the Brits \u2018pre-party\u2019 where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.\u2019 The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the \u2018second jobs\u2019 debate was partly the responsibility of Labour\u2019s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London\u2019s O2 Arena. Yorkshire-born Ms Winterton, who has never married and is renowned for her black leather boots, revels in her role in charge of party discipline. Commenting on the dispute, one source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna (pictured falling on stage) and Co\u2019 at the Brits . She learned her backroom wheeler-dealing skills from her mentor and close friend John Prescott, who gave her first break in politics \u2013 as tea girl in his office in 1980. Stylish Lancashire-born brunette Ms Powell has had a meteoric rise through the party\u2019s ranks. Only two years after becoming an MP, Miliband put her in charge of his Election campaign in November. A Labour MP said: \u2018Lucy and Rosie are a generation apart and totally different in their approach to politics. \u2018We have been waiting for this dust- up to occur.\u2019 A Labour spokesman said last night: \u2018There is no truth in this allegation.\u2019",

    "document": "Residents of rural communities could be forced to travel miles to their nearest bank after the biggest lenders refused to commit to never shut the \u2018last bank in town\u2019. After months of negotiation, the Government failed to secure the crucial agreement to protect customers, as bank bosses justify branch closures by stressing the soaring popularity of online banking. The High street banks have agreed to new industry-wide rules setting out a series of steps they must take before closing branches. Blame it on the internet: As they refuse to commit to never closing 'the last bank in town', bosses justify branch closures by stressing the soaring popularity of online banking . But critics say they do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut hundreds of branches across the country \u2013 even when there is no other bank in the community. Under the new regime banks will have to consult with local communities before any branch closure and ensure there are alternatives for customers such as free cash machines, \u2018mobile banking vans\u2019, and a local Post Office where they can sort out their finances. Existing rules stipulate that they have to go through this process only if they are closing the last branch in a town or village. Banks also have to give 12 weeks\u2019 notice before they shut a branch. Business secretary Vince Cable described the new \u2018protocol\u2019 as a \u2018major step forward\u2019 in ensuring those who do not bank online are \u2018not left behind\u2019. But last night Labour described the rules as another \u2018nail in the coffin for the High street\u2019, as all the major lenders have now ditched a previous commitment always to keep open the \u2018last bank in town\u2019. Vince Cable described the new \u2018protocol\u2019 as a \u2018major step forward\u2019 in ensuring those who do not bank online are \u2018not left behind\u2019 Lloyds became the last to do so in October, as it announced a three year plan to shut 200 branches and open 50. Efforts by Mr Cable to force banks to reinstate this commitment have been rejected and experts have warned that 978 branches around the country are now at risk. In total more than 500 branches are expected to be shut during the course of the year, with 210 closures announced so far. Of these 124 are the last branch in the community. For example, some 8,000 residents of Keynworth in Nottinghamshire have been left without a bank after the closure of their local NatWest branch earlier this year. and St Agnes in Cornwall has also lost its only branch after Barclays put down the shutters for the final time. There are now just over 9000 bank branches across the country, half the number of 25 years ago. Derek French from the Campaign for Community Banking said efforts by the coalition to beef up protection for consumers have failed. He said: . \u2018The government is trying to gloss over the fact that in reality it has achieved nothing and will not prevent hundreds of branches from disappearing from Britain\u2019s high streets. This is hugely damaging for local communities. The hardest hit will be small businesses, the elderly and the vulnerable \u2013 who rely heavily on their local bank\u2019. Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury said: \u2018This is a massive embarrassment for Vince Cable. Local communities sometimes rely on the basic services of a branch and this feels very much like another bail in the coffin for the High Street.\u2019 The bosses of all the major banks have justified the closure of branches by stressing the soaring popularity of digital banking \u2013 both online and on smart phones. They have also argued it is not viable to keep certain branches open because so few customers use them. Royal Bank of Scotland boss Ross McEwan last year described its busiest branch as the 7.01am train from Reading to London Paddington, with over 167,000 using its mobile banking app between 7am and 8am on their commute to work every day. The British Bankers\u2019 Association says internet and mobile banking is now used for transactions worth \u00a36.4 billion a week \u2013 up from \u00a35.8 billion last year. But according to charity Age UK, more than a third of older people have mobility problems making travelling long distances to their nearest branch difficult. Almost 15pc have limited dexterity which means it is hard to use the internet while 4.8 million people aged 65 and over have never been online. Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK said: \u2018Accessing cash and paying bills are essential services which must be easily available to everyone. But the combination of bank and building society closures, particularly in rural areas, and the industry\u2019s growing reliance on online services mean access has become increasingly difficult for many older people.\u2019 Vince Cable has said that the Post Office can play a vital role in providing an alternative for bank customers. Most banks already offer basic services via the Post Office\u2019s 11,500 branches.",

The Moscow Football Federation branded the incident 'outrageous'.

Pavlov is the father of two daughters, one of whom plays in his team, and he claimed he filmed his club Maximum-Brateevo's training sessions as proof there was no undue physical force or beating of children.

    "document": "Russian prosecutors are examining shocking footage of a football coach kicking a seven-year-old boy in the air during a training session. Valentin Pavlov claimed he was teaching Eugene Efimov how to kick the ball properly after the lad failed to show enough commitment in a tackle. He then ordered the frightened child to get back into the game. In the video, Valentin Pavol can be seen calling the seven-year-old player over to the sideline during training . He then kicks out at him in what he later claimed was an attempt to teach him how to use his feet more 'robustly' Eugene Efimov is sent flying into the air by the forceful kick which has outraged Russia . He twists in the air before landing on his back as another child, far right, watches on in horror . The Moscow Football Federation has branded the training drill incident 'outrageous' The powerful Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FBI, is deciding whether to bring charges for cruelty against Pavlov, but the coach claims his kick looked worse than it was. The Moscow Football Federation branded the incident 'outrageous'. 'I was explaining to the child how to use his foot in a more robust manner,' claimed the coach, who claimed the camera was at the wrong angle. 'I started showing him - and just then the child jumped. So I sort of touched him, and he flipped in the air. 'Of course, there was not even a slightest intention to hurt him. This is a coincidence. 'He fell down in a theatrical manner so that it looked like he was hurt. The person who filmed it was lucky to catch this angle.' Pavlov is the father of two daughters, one of whom plays in his team, and he claimed he filmed his club Maximum-Brateevo's training sessions as proof there was no undue physical force or beating of children. While he did not apologise to the Eugene Efimov after the kick, he claims he has done so since. But after the video went viral, the youngster's mother Alyona Efimova, 35, was tracked down and she refused to criticise the coach. Left, Valentin Pavlov, the coach who denies kicking\u00a0Eugene Efimov (right) with the intent of hurting him . She said: 'I was at the match and watching the game, and it was just part of the game. The video doesn't show anything really special, my son has been training for football with this coach for three years and we haven't had any problems up until now, and I still don't see a problem.' The video however has underlined a tough attitude that many parents in Russia have to raising children, where violence from parents or teachers is still often regarded as acceptable as a way of making sure they grow up properly. Asked if he was angry at the kick, the boy told local TV: 'No. I am not mad at him, I fell down because I jumped, I didn't feel any pain, it just looked bad.' While the footage has caused outrage in Russia, without a complaint, the Investigative Committee may not take further action. After the boy got back to his feet, Mr Pavlov then appeared to order him back into the game .",

    "document": "The chameleon\u2019s ability to change colour and blend into the background is famous. Now engineers have created artificial \u2018skin\u2019 that could one day be used to make soldiers\u2019 uniforms and give them the same ability as the colourful reptile. The incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand, by  bending it. Engineers have created artificial \u2018skin\u2019 that could one day be used to make soldiers\u2019 uniforms, giving them the  ability to blend into their surroundings like a chameleon . Researchers say the new material offers intriguing possibilities for an entirely new class of display technologies, colour-shifting camouflage, and sensors that could detect otherwise imperceptible defects in buildings, bridges and aircraft. \u2018This is the first time anybody has made a flexible chameleon-like skin that can change colour simply by flexing it,\u2019 said Professor Connie Chang-Hasnain, a member of the University of California Berkeley team that developed the material. They made the material by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair. The markings enabled them to select the range of colours the material would reflect, depending on how it was flexed and bent. Engineers made the material (illustrated) by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair . The incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand like a chameleon (stock image), by applying a minimal amount of force . Chameleons appear to be capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival. The process involves the active tuning of a lattice of microscopic crystals in skin cells called iridophores. Not only do the crystals allow the lizard to shift rapidly from efficient camouflage and spectacular mating displays, but they also protect it from overheating. It was previously thought that coloured pigments were gathered and dispersed inside different cells. The colours we see in paints and fabrics, for example, occur when white broad spectrum light strikes their surfaces. The unique chemical composition of each surface then absorbs various bands, or wavelengths of light. Bands that aren\u2019t absorbed are reflected back, with shorter wavelengths giving objects a blue hue and longer wavelengths appearing redder, with a rainbow of possible combinations in between. While autumn leaves change colour because of a shift in their chemical make-up, the researchers say they can transform the shade of their material by controlling the surface features on the tiniest of scales so they interact and reflect particular wavelengths of light. Professor Chang-Hasnain said that such \u2018structural colour\u2019 is much less common in nature, but is used by some butterflies and beetles to create a an iridescent display. To make the material, the Berkeley team etched rows of ridges onto a thin layer of silicon, which was set into a layer of silicone for flexibility. Rather than spreading the light into a complete rainbow, the ridges reflect a specific wavelength of light. Other applications for the new material include new types of advertising boards, active camouflage coatings for cars and sensors that could chnage colour to indicate\u00a0structural fatigue in bridges, for example. A stock image of Crescent City Connection Bridge in New Orleans is shown . By \u2018tuning\u2019 the spaces between the ridges, Professor Chang-Hasnain said it is possible to select the specific colour to be reflected. They realised it would be possible to subtly shift the spaces between the ridges, and therefore the colour, by flexing or bending the material. As the silicone is bent or flexed, the gaps between the ridges respond .

Now engineers have created artificial \u2018skin\u2019 that could one day be used to make soldiers\u2019 uniforms and give them the same ability as the colourful reptile. The incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand, by  bending it. Engineers have created artificial \u2018skin\u2019 that could one day be used to make soldiers\u2019 uniforms, giving them the  ability to blend into their surroundings like a chameleon . Researchers say the new material offers intriguing possibilities for an entirely new class of display technologies, colour-shifting camouflage, and sensors that could detect otherwise imperceptible defects in buildings, bridges and aircraft. \u2018This is the first time anybody has made a flexible chameleon-like skin that can change colour simply by flexing it,\u2019 said Professor Connie Chang-Hasnain, a member of the University of California Berkeley team that developed the material. They made the material by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair. The markings enabled them to select the range of colours the material would reflect, depending on how it was flexed and bent. Engineers made the material (illustrated) by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair . The incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand like a chameleon (stock image), by applying a minimal amount of force . Chameleons appear to be capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival. The process involves the active tuning of a lattice of microscopic crystals in skin cells called iridophores. Not only do the crystals allow the lizard to shift rapidly from efficient camouflage and spectacular mating displays, but they also protect it from overheating. It was previously thought that coloured pigments were gathered and dispersed inside different cells. The colours we see in paints and fabrics, for example, occur when white broad spectrum light strikes their surfaces. The unique chemical composition of each surface then absorbs various bands, or wavelengths of light. Bands that aren\u2019t absorbed are reflected back, with shorter wavelengths giving objects a blue hue and longer wavelengths appearing redder, with a rainbow of possible combinations in between. While autumn leaves change colour because of a shift in their chemical make-up, the researchers say they can transform the shade of their material by controlling the surface features on the tiniest of scales so they interact and reflect particular wavelengths of light. Professor Chang-Hasnain said that such \u2018structural colour\u2019 is much less common in nature, but is used by some butterflies and beetles to create a an iridescent display. To make the material, the Berkeley team etched rows of ridges onto a thin layer of silicon, which was set into a layer of silicone for flexibility. Rather than spreading the light into a complete rainbow, the ridges reflect a specific wavelength of light. Other applications for the new material include new types of advertising boards, active camouflage coatings for cars and sensors that could chnage colour to indicate\u00a0structural fatigue in bridges, for example. A stock image of Crescent City Connection Bridge in New Orleans is shown . By \u2018tuning\u2019 the spaces between the ridges, Professor Chang-Hasnain said it is possible to select the specific colour to be reflected. They realised it would be possible to subtly shift the spaces between the ridges, and therefore the colour, by flexing or bending the material.

To openly identify as an atheist in the midst of heavy religious influence can be next to impossible, and good luck finding other blacks who also don't believe.

There are now a number of secular groups that have helped to bring about more diverse representation for people of color, women and children. There is a more concentrated focus on support for the LGBT demographic, as well for others who come from marginalized and disfranchised backgrounds. There are support systems for people who have lost loved ones, yet they have no religious affiliation. Moreover, there is a tremendous amount of literary and artistic talent. Such representation is now reflected at organized events, in leadership, as well as in media coverage.

In a CNN special that aired on Tuesday, for example, people of color were not as well-represented as American atheism's more familiar face: You know, white males. In fact, African-American atheists represent a still small -- though growing -- segment of American atheists at large. Does this mean that blacks and other minorities generally just don't gravitate towards nonbelief, or are there other factors which keep us hidden? There is a harsh truth to face here.

It is not uncommon to assume that I attend services as a black woman. The question often isn't if I go to church -- it's where. And even if one doesn't go to church, surely they still have faith -- because our people have endured and overcome so much hardship that it had to be the work of a god. All of this makes the words \"black\" and \"atheist\" hard for many to imagine in the same sentence. It can be extremely difficult to discuss religion objectively in the black community. Many have social, emotional and financial stakes invested in this institution, so for one to even say they have doubts is like committing treason. To openly identify as an atheist in the midst of heavy religious influence can be next to impossible, and good luck finding other blacks who also don't believe. It is very important to note however, that the Internet has made it easier for black atheists to find each other, and there is a large community of us online.

However, my journey is far from tragic. In founding my organization, Black Nonbelievers, in 2011, I have been fortunate to connect with others who were either raised secular like myself, or who were brought up extremely religious and left it behind.

    "document": "Rima Karak has won wide-spread support after defending herself against Islamist\u00a0Hani Al-Seba'i . A female Lebanese TV host has won wide-spread support after standing her ground against an Islamist scholar following his sexist comments live on air. Rima Karaki was conducting an interview with London-based Islamist Hani Al-Seba'i for Lebanon's Al Jadeed on the weekend of International Women\u2019s Day, discussing reports of Christians joining Islamic groups such as ISIS in the Middle East when the scholar went off on a historical tangent. In the footage, Karaki urges Sheik Al-Seba'i to get back to the issues being faced in the present day, and asks him another question, a request which sparks a heated argument. 'It was at its peak during the 1970s, with the leftist revolutionary movement,' he says. 'Back then, we saw leftist organisation like the Red Brigades in Italy, the Red Army in Germany, the Baader Meinhof Group ...' Karaki tries to get Al-Seba'i back on topic, asking him to 'focus on the present'. She asks: 'At present, what slogans are used to attract (Christians) to these groups?' But Dr Al Seba\u2019i becomes angry and abruptly replies: 'Listen, don't cut me off. I will answer as I please.' He then raises his voice, adding: 'I will not answer the way you like, because I\u2019m here to serve the idea in which I believe.' Karaki politely explains that they have limited time on the show, but Al-Seba'i refuses to listen, telling the TV host he would not be interrupted and that he will answer as he pleases. Lebanese TV host Rima Karaki is being praised on social media for her cool reaction to sexist comments made by\u00a0Sheik Al-Seba'i on a live interview . The host then lets the scholar know exactly who's in charge. 'In this studio, I run the show,' Karaki says. It provokes an angry reaction from Al-Seba'i. 'Are you done?' he says. 'Shut up so I can talk. 'It's beneath me to be interviewed by you. You are a woman who...' 'If you are going to elaborate so much, we won\u2019t have time for other questions. 'Now, it\u2019s up to you. If we have time, you will answer all the questions,' she says. Dr Al Seba'i replies: \u201cYou can decide as much as you like, but I will do whatever I want.' Rima Karaki asserts her authority over the situation as\u00a0Sheik Al-Seba'i starts to get worked up . London-based Sheik Al-Seba'i then rudely tells the TV host to shut up as he carries on talking over her . With her palm facing the Sheikh, Karaki then delivers the ultimate end to the conversation. 'How can a respected Sheik like yourself tell a TV host to shut up?' she asks. 'Either there is mutual respect or the conversation is over.' The studio cameras then switch back to the studio leaving the Sheik in the dark. Karaki later posted a video of the conversation on her Twitter feed, which has gone viral and received widespread support. It has had 2.3million views on YouTube. Ania Sowinski tweeted: 'The awesome and beautiful Rima Karaki. A great role model for young women #respect.' Raji Abi Rached added: 'Good job on putting disrespectful people in their place #WomensDay.' The Sheik then delivers the now infamous jibe that it is 'beneath' him to be interviewed by her . Rima Karaki is astounded that a respected Sheik would tell a TV host to shut up live on air . Rima Karaki is a TV anchor and university professor, who started her career in 1998 as one of the main hosts of the Arab world's most imitated morning programme Alam al Sabah. After 10 years on the show, Karaki moved on to co-host and produce Personal Matters, that dealt with Arab viewers' intimate issues. In 2010, Karaki hosted celebrity-themed show Ana Wiyyak (You And I). Her first book Tonight I will Confess has received critical acclaim in literary circles and she is now the host for Bidoun Zaal, where she interviews public figures and discusses issues related to society, politics and religion. London-based Sheik Hani Al-Siba'i is Director of London's Al-Maqreze Centre for Historical Studies Hani Sibai. He has previously claimed that \u2018anyone who is not a Muslim is a criminal\u2019 and is seen as a controversial figure who has often made offensive comments in interviews. Speaking to Al-Jazeera TV on July 8, 2005, the Sheik caused great outrage by saying that the London bombings were a victory: \u2018If Al-Qaeda indeed carried out this act [of the bombings], it is a great victory for it. It rubbed the noses of the world's eight most powerful countries in the mud.\u2019 The row comes as global views on women\u2019s rights face more scrutiny than ever before. Last month, a manifesto - reportedly written by an all-women Islamic State militia - advised that nine is a good age to consider marriage for girls, who should have husbands by 16. It also said women must stay behind closed doors, be veiled and only leave the house in exceptional circumstances. While in India, a documentary caused outrage last week in which convicted rapist Mukesh Singh blamed his victim Jyoti Singh for the attack. The news anchor won support on social media, with many defending her reaction .",

    "document": "Rima Karak has won wide-spread support after defending herself against Islamist\u00a0Hani Al-Seba'i . A female Lebanese TV host has won wide-spread support after standing her ground against an Islamist scholar following his sexist comments live on air. Rima Karaki was conducting an interview with London-based Islamist Hani Al-Seba'i for Lebanon's Al Jadeed on the weekend of International Women\u2019s Day, discussing reports of Christians joining Islamic groups such as ISIS in the Middle East when the scholar went off on a historical tangent. In the footage, Karaki urges Sheik Al-Seba'i to get back to the issues being faced in the present day, and asks him another question, a request which sparks a heated argument. 'It was at its peak during the 1970s, with the leftist revolutionary movement,' he says. 'Back then, we saw leftist organisation like the Red Brigades in Italy, the Red Army in Germany, the Baader Meinhof Group ...' Karaki tries to get Al-Seba'i back on topic, asking him to 'focus on the present'. She asks: 'At present, what slogans are used to attract (Christians) to these groups?' But Dr Al Seba\u2019i becomes angry and abruptly replies: 'Listen, don't cut me off. I will answer as I please.' He then raises his voice, adding: 'I will not answer the way you like, because I\u2019m here to serve the idea in which I believe.' Karaki politely explains that they have limited time on the show, but Al-Seba'i refuses to listen, telling the TV host he would not be interrupted and that he will answer as he pleases. Lebanese TV host Rima Karaki is being praised on social media for her cool reaction to sexist comments made by\u00a0Sheik Al-Seba'i on a live interview . The host then lets the scholar know exactly who's in charge. 'In this studio, I run the show,' Karaki says. It provokes an angry reaction from Al-Seba'i. 'Are you done?' he says. 'Shut up so I can talk. 'It's beneath me to be interviewed by you. You are a woman who...' 'If you are going to elaborate so much, we won\u2019t have time for other questions. 'Now, it\u2019s up to you. If we have time, you will answer all the questions,' she says. Dr Al Seba'i replies: \u201cYou can decide as much as you like, but I will do whatever I want.' Rima Karaki asserts her authority over the situation as\u00a0Sheik Al-Seba'i starts to get worked up . London-based Sheik Al-Seba'i then rudely tells the TV host to shut up as he carries on talking over her . With her palm facing the Sheikh, Karaki then delivers the ultimate end to the conversation. 'How can a respected Sheik like yourself tell a TV host to shut up?' she asks. 'Either there is mutual respect or the conversation is over.' The studio cameras then switch back to the studio leaving the Sheik in the dark. Karaki later posted a video of the conversation on her Twitter feed, which has gone viral and received widespread support. It has had 2.3million views on YouTube. Ania Sowinski tweeted: 'The awesome and beautiful Rima Karaki. A great role model for young women #respect.' Raji Abi Rached added: 'Good job on putting disrespectful people in their place #WomensDay.' The Sheik then delivers the now infamous jibe that it is 'beneath' him to be interviewed by her . Rima Karaki is astounded that a respected Sheik would tell a TV host to shut up live on air . Rima Karaki is a TV anchor and university professor, who started her career in 1998 as one of the main hosts of the Arab world's most imitated morning programme Alam al Sabah. After 10 years on the show, Karaki moved on to co-host and produce Personal Matters, that dealt with Arab viewers' intimate issues. In 2010, Karaki hosted celebrity-themed show Ana Wiyyak (You And I).

'I had a hold of his throat and the guy on the other side had his knee right on the back of his neck, and every time he would struggle, I would squeeze his throat and the guy would put pressure on the back of his neck.' Badger was not permanently injured from the bullet that grazed the back of his head, but he showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, his wife said.

Matthew and Cheryl Jewell have had enough of 'embarrassing' noises coming from the sex club above their Stovestore business in Chorley, Lancashire. Despite their attempts to drown out the sounds, they claim customers are being driven away by the noises, which start around lunchtime. Matthew and Cheryl Jewell (pictured) claim it is 'embarrassing' when customers in their shop can hear screaming from upstairs . Mrs Jewell said: 'Customers are stood here and they're screaming upstairs. I'm going red, customers are going red and they're leaving the shop. 'We've spent thousands of pounds here and we're going to have to leave. We have so many customers that return to us here.' Despite their protestations, a representative of the No 3 swingers club, which has been open for two years, claims they are doing nothing wrong. No 3 Club owner, who said she only wanted to known as Mary, said she had suggested soundproofing, and had changed a day the club opened so it did not conflict with when the Stovestore was open. She said: 'I've done everything I possibly can. I don't want them to move. I don't think they like my type of business. They knew what it was before they moved in. 'I'm very disappointed and quite upset they're moving. I'll be sorry. I don't want to interfere with anybody else's business.' Problems began for Mr and Mrs Jewell when the No 3 Club expanded its opening hours into the working day, as well as its late night and early hours opening. 'It's more frequent now, they're open from 1pm onwards,' said Mrs Jewell. 'We were changing all our days for when they were noisiest.

According to the No 3 Club website, daytime activities include 'greedy girl day', which takes place on the first Wednesday of every month, between noon and 10pm. The two businesses share a landlord, Frank Patterson, who said he has asked No 3 Club to take steps improve the situation. Mr Patterson said: 'The No 3 Club came into the unit five years ago, Cheryl and Matthew have been there two years. There were two other tenants before them and it wasn't a problem.

Problems began for Mr and Mrs Jewell when the No 3 Club expanded its opening hours into the working day, as well as its late night and early hours opening. 'It's more frequent now, they're open from 1pm onwards,' said Mrs Jewell. 'We were changing all our days for when they were noisiest. 'We know what's going on up there, but we can't do anything about it. Nobody can help.' The club website advertises the first Wednesday of every month as 'greedy girl day' beginning at midday . The Jewell's business The Stovestore (pictured) may be forced to close due to the noises from upstairs . The couple, who have owned the shop for two years, have complained to Chorley Council, but say their only option is to leave. Mrs Jewell added: 'We've made a couple of complaints, but there's no law for sexual activities. It's two years now just wasted.' According to the No 3 Club website, daytime activities include 'greedy girl day', which takes place on the first Wednesday of every month, between noon and 10pm. The two businesses share a landlord, Frank Patterson, who said he has asked No 3 Club to take steps improve the situation. Mr Patterson said: 'The No 3 Club came into the unit five years ago, Cheryl and Matthew have been there two years. There were two other tenants before them and it wasn't a problem. 'Now the No 3 Club has extended its hours into the working day. 'I've heard the noises and it's not acceptable. I've spoken to the No 3 Club about it on numerous occasions on behalf of Cheryl and Matthew and they've made no effort to improve the situation. If anything it's got worse.' He added: 'I've written to the No 3 Club and, if and when they renew their lease, I've told them there will be a restriction on them operating during the working day.' Councillor Paul Walmsley, from Chorley Council, said: 'The council has received a complaint about the No.3 Club, but as both parties are commercial premises, we do not have the powers to enforce nuisance proceedings. 'We will, however, continue to ensure they are compliant with their licence agreement as we would do with any other premises.'",
    "summary": "jewell had had enough of'em barrassing' noises coming from the sex club. they claim customers are being driven away by the noises. matthew and cheryl jewell claim it is'em barrassing' when customers can hear. no 3 swingers club has been open for two years. the club opened so it did not conflict with the stovestore was open."

    "document": "An unconscious patient secretly raped in A&E by a male nurse who filmed the attack admitted today she tried to kill herself after police revealed her ordeal. The victim, now 38, was one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic by\u00a0Andrew Hutchinson, 29, as they lay in hospital beds at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. She had no idea she had been raped until police arrived at her home and showed her images of the attack in February 2012. Sex offenders: Nurses Andrew Hutchinson and Oliver Balicao were able to rape patients at the A&E at John Radcliffe Hospital - where unconscious patients are now being treated in open areas . Crime scene: Hutchinson raped two women and Balicao raped another in the A&E department they worked in at\u00a0John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford (pictured) She told the Daily Mirror: 'I said, \"That\u2019s not me\" but I had my mum round and she said, \"That is you.\" 'I cut my wrists a few weeks afterwards. I knew what I was doing but I think it must have been a cry for help. 'It could have been going on for years and there could be a hell of a lot more victims out there'. The woman, who has children, was sent to hospital after banging her head, only to be attacked by the nurse while unconscious. She had today described the fear of having to wait two weeks to discover if she had any sexually transmitted disease, which came back clear. She said she has panic attacks, suffers severe mood swings and has developed a problem with alcohol. Her partner and the father of the children said: 'I want to kill him (Hutchinson). I'm angry and I don't trust anyone these days.' It emerged today that the A&E has now been forced to treat unconscious patients in open areas after two nurses were able to rape patients there in the past decade. In 2010 nurse Oliver Balicao, 42, a married father-of-two, was jailed for nine years after he raped a 17-year-old patient in the A&E and attacked  another in her  bed while working at the same hospital. A senior hospital manager has said that Hutchinson\u2019s crimes has led to a policy change where unconscious patients are now treated in one area with open visibility. But management today refused to explain how two staff in ten years were able to rape women in the hospital - feet away from staff and other patients. Caught on camera: This CCTV image shows Hutchinson, top, in the leisure centre where he was found to be spying on women, and his life of sexual crime was then revealed to police . A court heard yesterday how Hutchinson was 'addicted' to spying on women and children, and filmed his most serious attacks. The nurse even stole a medical camera from the hospital so he could film up a woman\u2019s skirt as she stood by her sick friend\u2019s bedside. Away from the hospital, Hutchinson volunteered as a paramedic at the trendy Wilderness festival in Oxfordshire where he groped two young women who had passed out in the medical tent. He also used the medical camera \u2013 which is routinely used by doctors to examine the internal organs of patients \u2013 to film girls as young as ten getting changed at his local leisure centre. The nurse was eventually caught by police after two girls at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, saw him lurking near the women\u2019s changing rooms and raised the alarm. Hutchinson was arrested in November 2013 by police officers outside the leisure centre. Detectives found footage of his attacks on his mobile phone, computer, a memory stick and a camera. They also found 1,786 indecent images of children on his computer and phone. Hutchinson appeared at Oxford Crown Court yesterday where he pleaded guilty to all 28 charges put to him. He admitted two counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity, 12 counts of voyeurism, five counts of making indecent images of children, one count of outraging public decency, two counts of theft and one count of possession of a Class B drug. The court heard that police had identified ten victims \u2013 females aged from ten to 35. Police have been unable to trace one of the victims who was attacked at the hospital and they have been unable to establish the identities of a further 18 victims who were filmed by Hutchinson at the leisure centre. Caught: The nurse was found to be filming victims at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon . His rape victims were an 18-year-old woman attacked in October 2011 and a 35-year-old woman abused in February 2012. Both were under general anaesthetic at the time in the A&E department. Hutchinson, who had a girlfriend, became a nurse on the A&E wing of John Radcliffe Hospital in 2006. At some point he was promoted to the rank of senior nurse which meant he was trusted to treat patients on his own - he will be sentenced next month. Theft: The nurse stole this\u00a0Nasopharyngoscope - used for inernal examinations - and used it to film up a woman's skirt as she visited a friend in hospital . Mark Power, Director of Workforce at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'The ultimate responsibility for these appalling offences must rest with Andrew Hutchinson. Our staff have been devastated by his actions and his betrayal of their trust. It is not possible to eliminate the risk of a rogue practitioner entirely. 'This does not absolve anybody from learning lessons from these terrible events and we have taken steps to eliminate the possibility of this happening again. Our emergency department is now busier than ever and patients who are unconscious are treated in one area of the department with open visibility. At the time of the offences, this group of patients were more spread out within the department.' It emerged today that it is not the first rape scandal on its A&E ward. Nurse\u00a0Oliver Balicao raped a teenager in a side room after she had been rushed to hospital after an overdose in 2004. Her mother and the girl\u2019s boyfriend did not believe her because she was hallucinating but years later she came forward and he was convicted in 2010. Balicao had even used a condom to hide DNA evidence in the premeditated attack. He was also found guilty of a sexual assault on a 22-year-old PHD student who was attacked in her hospital bed. Balicao was previously jailed in 2007 for 16 months for having sex with a 16-year-old patient in a disabled toilet at the hospital after she had overdosed on paracetamol. The girl had accused him of raping her when luring her in saying she needed to do a urine test - but a jury cleared him of rape and accepted a guilty plea of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust.",
    "summary": "victim, now 38, was one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic. she had no idea she had been raped until police arrived at her home. nurses andrew hutchinson and oliver balicao were able to rape patients at the hospital. the woman was sent to hospital after banging her head, only to be attacked. she was secretly raped in a&e by a male nurse who filmed the attack."

    "document": "An unconscious patient secretly raped in A&E by a male nurse who filmed the attack admitted today she tried to kill herself after police revealed her ordeal. The victim, now 38, was one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic by\u00a0Andrew Hutchinson, 29, as they lay in hospital beds at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. She had no idea she had been raped until police arrived at her home and showed her images of the attack in February 2012. Sex offenders: Nurses Andrew Hutchinson and Oliver Balicao were able to rape patients at the A&E at John Radcliffe Hospital - where unconscious patients are now being treated in open areas . Crime scene: Hutchinson raped two women and Balicao raped another in the A&E department they worked in at\u00a0John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford (pictured) She told the Daily Mirror: 'I said, \"That\u2019s not me\" but I had my mum round and she said, \"That is you.\" 'I cut my wrists a few weeks afterwards. I knew what I was doing but I think it must have been a cry for help. 'It could have been going on for years and there could be a hell of a lot more victims out there'. The woman, who has children, was sent to hospital after banging her head, only to be attacked by the nurse while unconscious. She had today described the fear of having to wait two weeks to discover if she had any sexually transmitted disease, which came back clear. She said she has panic attacks, suffers severe mood swings and has developed a problem with alcohol. Her partner and the father of the children said: 'I want to kill him (Hutchinson). I'm angry and I don't trust anyone these days.' It emerged today that the A&E has now been forced to treat unconscious patients in open areas after two nurses were able to rape patients there in the past decade. In 2010 nurse Oliver Balicao, 42, a married father-of-two, was jailed for nine years after he raped a 17-year-old patient in the A&E and attacked  another in her  bed while working at the same hospital. A senior hospital manager has said that Hutchinson\u2019s crimes has led to a policy change where unconscious patients are now treated in one area with open visibility. But management today refused to explain how two staff in ten years were able to rape women in the hospital - feet away from staff and other patients. Caught on camera: This CCTV image shows Hutchinson, top, in the leisure centre where he was found to be spying on women, and his life of sexual crime was then revealed to police . A court heard yesterday how Hutchinson was 'addicted' to spying on women and children, and filmed his most serious attacks. The nurse even stole a medical camera from the hospital so he could film up a woman\u2019s skirt as she stood by her sick friend\u2019s bedside. Away from the hospital, Hutchinson volunteered as a paramedic at the trendy Wilderness festival in Oxfordshire where he groped two young women who had passed out in the medical tent. He also used the medical camera \u2013 which is routinely used by doctors to examine the internal organs of patients \u2013 to film girls as young as ten getting changed at his local leisure centre. The nurse was eventually caught by police after two girls at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, saw him lurking near the women\u2019s changing rooms and raised the alarm. Hutchinson was arrested in November 2013 by police officers outside the leisure centre. Detectives found footage of his attacks on his mobile phone, computer, a memory stick and a camera. They also found 1,786 indecent images of children on his computer and phone. Hutchinson appeared at Oxford Crown Court yesterday where he pleaded guilty to all 28 charges put to him. He admitted two counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity, 12 counts of voyeurism, five counts of making indecent images of children, one count of outraging public decency, two counts of theft and one count of possession of a Class B drug. The court heard that police had identified ten victims \u2013 females aged from ten to 35. Police have been unable to trace one of the victims who was attacked at the hospital and they have been unable to establish the identities of a further 18 victims who were filmed by Hutchinson at the leisure centre.

    "document": "It's a chapter of Hugh Jackman's life not many people know about. The Hollywood star once said he only 'truly grew up' when he spent months working with in Australia's most remote Indigenous communities. Now he has added his voice to an effort to stop the West Australian government's effort to shut down as many as half of the state's 270 remote communities. Scroll down for video . Lending his voice: Movie star Hugh Jackman has thrown his support behind efforts to stop the forced closure of some remote Indigenous communities . Jackman was lobbied by Indigenous fans who called on him to step up and announce his support . A young child wields the sign aimed at Jackman, who has expressed how grateful he is for the time he has spent in remote communities . 'This is my country': As many as a thousand people could be forced to move if the WA State Government plan goes ahead . In a message posted on social media, Jackman said: 'While living in a remote community I came to understand the 'connection' to land is a fundamental part of Indigenous identity, think about the past, have quality conversations.\u00a0I SUPPORT YOU'. Indigenous leaders have been highly critical of the state government's plans, which could involve the forced removal of more than 1000 people. Many were angered by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's remarks that governments could not 'endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices'. Jackman reflected upon what he learned living on the land while 'nursing a broken heart' in an interview with Canada's George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight several years ago. 'Day after day, week after week, there's a magical effect the landscape had, and that the Aboriginal people had,' he said. He told his father 'I think I'm going to live out here forever' but his father said he should finish college first and evaluate his options then. The X-Men star said he was inspired by the Indigenous people's sense of community and togetherness. Rally:\u00a0Members and supporters of the Aboriginal community are pictured demonstrating against the West Australian government's plan to close remote Aboriginal communities . The rally was part of a national day of action against the proposed closures . In an interview with a Canadian broadcaster years ago, Jackman said he was tempted to live in the outback with remote communities for a long time .

    "document": "It is something most of us prefer not to see when we open our fridge. But photographer Nick Lariontsev has captured mould in a way that may make you look at that out-of-date bread and cheese in a different way. Using macroscopic photography techniques, he has created a strangely beautiful timelapse video that shows mould fungi as they grow and spread. Using macroscopic photography, Russian photographer Nick Lariontsev has created a captivating yet stomach-churning timelapse video that shows mould fungi as it grows and spread (grab shown) The multicellular filaments slowly spread across the Petri dish before forming mounds and ridges that look more like the alien landscape of another planet. He has also managed to capture the tiny clusters of spores on the end of stalks that give many moulds their dusty appearance. Mr Lariontsev, a photographer based in Russia who posted the video on YouTube, said it took him between two and eight days to capture each of the individual sequences in the film. Among the moulds he filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice. Among the moulds in the film are the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice.\u00a0The fungi Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, and the soil-based fungi Trichoderma . Fungi from the group of Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, along with the soil-based fungi Trichoderma. The fungal genus Botrytis, some of which often infect soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the genus Mucor, which grow on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days. The result is a rather stomach-churning but strangely captivating four-minute long video showing the fungi as few people will have seen it before. Professor Lynne Boddy, a fungal ecologist at Cardiff University and a member of the British Mycological Society, said: 'Most people think yuk when they see fungi as they see it rot their food and kill their plants. 'But if it wasn't for fungi we would not be here today as it shapes the world around us. 'If fungi did not rot wood and leaves in the forest, then the nutrients locked up inside them would never be freed up in the soil. 'Many fungi also form mycorrhizal relationships with the roots of plants and if it was not for them then the plants could not grow. 'Fungi are actually hugely important yet largely overlooked.' The fungi Botrytis, which often infects on soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the fungi Mucor, which grows on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days . It sounds more like the recipe  for a good pasta sauce, but scientists have created a new edible coating that extends the shelf-life of cheese from seafood, rosemary and oregano. The transparent film uses extracts from the shells of crustaceans with oregano and rosemary oils to keep cheese from drying out and help prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria. Tests have shown that the coating is as effective as anti-fungal chemicals and plastic coatings that are currently used to protect some cheeses by the dairy industry. The researchers claim that the new coating will be particularly useful for soft cheeses like ricotta but could also help prevent mature cheeses like brie and blue cheeses from spoiling. While helping to prevent the cheese from going off, it is also completely edible and so will not need to be removed like some artificial rinds that are used. Professor Chelo Gonz\u00e1lez, a researcher at the Institute of Food Engineering for Development of the\u00a0Polytechnic University of Valencia, said:\u00a0'The most common causes of deterioration are excessive surface dehydration and the growth of micro-organisms such as fungus or yeasts.

But photographer Nick Lariontsev has captured mould in a way that may make you look at that out-of-date bread and cheese in a different way. Using macroscopic photography techniques, he has created a strangely beautiful timelapse video that shows mould fungi as they grow and spread. Using macroscopic photography, Russian photographer Nick Lariontsev has created a captivating yet stomach-churning timelapse video that shows mould fungi as it grows and spread (grab shown) The multicellular filaments slowly spread across the Petri dish before forming mounds and ridges that look more like the alien landscape of another planet. He has also managed to capture the tiny clusters of spores on the end of stalks that give many moulds their dusty appearance. Mr Lariontsev, a photographer based in Russia who posted the video on YouTube, said it took him between two and eight days to capture each of the individual sequences in the film. Among the moulds he filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice. Among the moulds in the film are the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice.\u00a0The fungi Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, and the soil-based fungi Trichoderma . Fungi from the group of Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, along with the soil-based fungi Trichoderma. The fungal genus Botrytis, some of which often infect soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the genus Mucor, which grow on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days. The result is a rather stomach-churning but strangely captivating four-minute long video showing the fungi as few people will have seen it before. Professor Lynne Boddy, a fungal ecologist at Cardiff University and a member of the British Mycological Society, said: 'Most people think yuk when they see fungi as they see it rot their food and kill their plants. 'But if it wasn't for fungi we would not be here today as it shapes the world around us. 'If fungi did not rot wood and leaves in the forest, then the nutrients locked up inside them would never be freed up in the soil. 'Many fungi also form mycorrhizal relationships with the roots of plants and if it was not for them then the plants could not grow. 'Fungi are actually hugely important yet largely overlooked.' The fungi Botrytis, which often infects on soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the fungi Mucor, which grows on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days . It sounds more like the recipe  for a good pasta sauce, but scientists have created a new edible coating that extends the shelf-life of cheese from seafood, rosemary and oregano. The transparent film uses extracts from the shells of crustaceans with oregano and rosemary oils to keep cheese from drying out and help prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria. Tests have shown that the coating is as effective as anti-fungal chemicals and plastic coatings that are currently used to protect some cheeses by the dairy industry. The researchers claim that the new coating will be particularly useful for soft cheeses like ricotta but could also help prevent mature cheeses like brie and blue cheeses from spoiling. While helping to prevent the cheese from going off, it is also completely edible and so will not need to be removed like some artificial rinds that are used. Professor Chelo Gonz\u00e1lez, a researcher at the Institute of Food Engineering for Development of the\u00a0Polytechnic University of Valencia, said:\u00a0'The most common causes of deterioration are excessive surface dehydration and the growth of micro-organisms such as fungus or yeasts. 'These produce a strange flavour or odour, a slimy texture and a significant visual alteration. 'Using a natural and edible product reduces the fungal problems and controls the weight loss during the maturing.' The researchers coated Tronchon cheese (labelled queso Tronchon recubierto) with a combination of\u00a0chitosan, which is extracted from crustacean shells, and essential oils from rosemary and oregano .",

Trey Gowdy chairs a special congressional committee looking into the Benghazi attacks, and has subpoenaed emails from 'close to a dozen' current and past Clinton aides . Cheryl Mills (left) was Clinton's chief of staff at the State Department and reportedly used an off-the-books email address to trade messages with the then-secretary of state, potentially putting their work emails beyond the reach of government investigators . BECAUSE I'M HAPPY? Clinton is her party's presumed presidential front-runner, having come in second to Barack Obama in 2008 . A spokesman for the Republican-controlled House Select . Committee on Benghazi declined to comment, according to the . newspaper. Clinton has said she gave copies of all work-related emails . to the State Department, but Republicans, who see her as their . top target in the run-up to the 2016 election, continued to . press for more records. Last week Republicans asked the State Department to hand . over numerous documents related to Clinton's use of private . email while she was secretary of state and have called on her to . hand over her email server to a third party. Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who chairs the . House committee investigating Benghazi, has said he does not . think Clinton has given the committee all emails related to the . attack and last week extended the deadline for her to turn them . over.",

    "document": "The sight of birds pecking at seed or nuts from a garden feeder fills many people with joy. Now, a device called the Crow Box could enable bird watchers to make money from their hobby, as well as watch birds develop new skills. The training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins in return for peanuts, or simply test the intelligence of wild corvids. The Crow Box training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins in return for peanuts, or simply test the intelligence of wild corvids. People who want to train crows can follow the open-source instructions to make their own box (pictured left) which includes a perch and funnel to dispense tasty peanuts (right) Research has shown that crows have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old, and the birds can solve tasks previously only thought solvable by people and apes. The box is similar to a vending machine for birds, but crows have to use their brains to earn treats. So far, the Brooklyn-based maker of the box has managed to train captive crows to retrieve coins in return for peanuts and hopes that wild crows will learn the same tricks. The sealed wooden and plastic box comprises food dispensers, a 12 volt power supply, two motors, cables and sensors. It is powered and run by a laptop that can be placed up to 50ft (15 metres) away. Research has shown that crows (stock image) have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old, and the birds can solve tasks previously only thought solvable by people and apes . An experiment by the University of Cambridge has proved that members of the crow family, known as corvids, aren\u2019t just among the cleverest birds, they are smarter than most mammals and can perform tasks that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events, to solve similar problems. Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food, which the University of Oxford\u2019s Behavioural Ecology Research Group said is the first demonstration of spontaneous sequential tool use in a species other than humans. A study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. The device has a perch, a food tray and a funnel, designed to test a crow\u2019s cognitive abilities and incentivise them to learn new tricks. There are four steps (illustrated) to training crows to find coins, involving peanut rewards . To begin training, the device pushes a few peanuts and two coins into the feeder tray whenever a crow leaves the machine, which ensures food is always on offer and the sound of the machine is linked to the reward so the crow learns to accept it. The machine is then adapted so that it does the same thing when a crow arrives \u2013 training the bird to wait for its reward by visiting the machine. Once visiting crows have learned patience, the machine is changed again so it only dispenses coins and not peanuts. This part of the training is the highest risk, because it seemingly removes the incentive of nuts. But the contraption is designed so that if a bird pecks or sweeps coins off the tray \u2013 which is fitted with sensors \u2013 and into a funnel, peanuts are revealed and the bird's ingenuity is rewarded. This stage is designed to strengthen the relationship between the coins going down the funnel and food. The training is complete when crows bring coins of their own volition to unlock food. They may collect coins scattered nearby by the owners of the machine to encourage their behaviour, or travel further afield to collect bonus treasure. Gabi Mann, from Seattle, Washington, feeds the crows that visit her home with peanuts and they bring her gifts in exchange. The eight-year-old has built up collection of more than 70 shiny beads, buttons, pieces of metal, brightly coloured plastic and foam - all left for her by her corvid companions. Perhaps the most touching is a metal fragment with the word 'best' written on it - one half of a pendant that would be completed by the word 'friend' if reunited with the other part. Among her most prized presents from the neighbourhood crows is a pearl-coloured heart. 'It's showing me how much they love me,' Gabi told the podcast The BitterSweet Life and the BBC. 'They give me all the special stuff you could ever find. 'We know these are from the crows that sometimes they are rusted and dirty and nothing like what a person would carry around. Sometimes we find them on the bird feeder.' As Gabi throws the food for the birds, crowds of crows - known as a murder - gather on telephone lines and the nearby fence. In return the crows now leave trinkets on the empty bird feeder - including a broken light bulb, earrings, pieces of Lego, rusted screws, polished rocks and glass beads. The open source experiment is designed to look further into the brains of corvids. \u2018The more people trying different things the faster we'll all figure out how to work cooperatively with crows,\u2019 hacker and writer Joshua Klein writes on the Crow Box website. \u2018Once we\u2019ve got the system optimised for teaching coin collection we can move to seeing how flexibly they can learn other tasks, like collecting garbage, sorting through discarded electronics, or maybe even search and rescue.\u2019 The box is similar to a vending machine for birds, but crows have to use their brains to earn treats.

The device has a perch, a food tray and a funnel, designed to test a crow\u2019s cognitive abilities and incentivise them to learn new tricks. There are four steps (illustrated) to training crows to find coins, involving peanut rewards . To begin training, the device pushes a few peanuts and two coins into the feeder tray whenever a crow leaves the machine, which ensures food is always on offer and the sound of the machine is linked to the reward so the crow learns to accept it. The machine is then adapted so that it does the same thing when a crow arrives \u2013 training the bird to wait for its reward by visiting the machine. Once visiting crows have learned patience, the machine is changed again so it only dispenses coins and not peanuts. This part of the training is the highest risk, because it seemingly removes the incentive of nuts. But the contraption is designed so that if a bird pecks or sweeps coins off the tray \u2013 which is fitted with sensors \u2013 and into a funnel, peanuts are revealed and the bird's ingenuity is rewarded. This stage is designed to strengthen the relationship between the coins going down the funnel and food. The training is complete when crows bring coins of their own volition to unlock food. They may collect coins scattered nearby by the owners of the machine to encourage their behaviour, or travel further afield to collect bonus treasure. Gabi Mann, from Seattle, Washington, feeds the crows that visit her home with peanuts and they bring her gifts in exchange. The eight-year-old has built up collection of more than 70 shiny beads, buttons, pieces of metal, brightly coloured plastic and foam - all left for her by her corvid companions. Perhaps the most touching is a metal fragment with the word 'best' written on it - one half of a pendant that would be completed by the word 'friend' if reunited with the other part. Among her most prized presents from the neighbourhood crows is a pearl-coloured heart. 'It's showing me how much they love me,' Gabi told the podcast The BitterSweet Life and the BBC. 'They give me all the special stuff you could ever find. 'We know these are from the crows that sometimes they are rusted and dirty and nothing like what a person would carry around. Sometimes we find them on the bird feeder.' As Gabi throws the food for the birds, crowds of crows - known as a murder - gather on telephone lines and the nearby fence. In return the crows now leave trinkets on the empty bird feeder - including a broken light bulb, earrings, pieces of Lego, rusted screws, polished rocks and glass beads. The open source experiment is designed to look further into the brains of corvids. \u2018The more people trying different things the faster we'll all figure out how to work cooperatively with crows,\u2019 hacker and writer Joshua Klein writes on the Crow Box website. \u2018Once we\u2019ve got the system optimised for teaching coin collection we can move to seeing how flexibly they can learn other tasks, like collecting garbage, sorting through discarded electronics, or maybe even search and rescue.\u2019 The box is similar to a vending machine for birds, but crows have to use their brains to earn treats. The sealed wooden and plastic box comprises food dispensers, a 12 volt power supply, two motors, cables and sensors. Some of the inner workings are shown here . Members of the crow family are known to be among the cleverest of birds, but scientists are finding that they may have intelligence that rivals most mammals and even young children. An experiment by the University of Cambridge showed that crows can perform task that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events, to solve similar problems. The programme shows 007 the crow completing the eight stage puzzle in approximately two-and-a-half minutes. The individual processes are detailed in this diagram . Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food. A study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. The problem-solving creature performed the series of tasks without seeing the fiendishly difficult set up of the course beforehand. The wild crow learned to use individual props during its three months of captivity but had to work out the order in which to use them to complete the challenge and get an inaccessible treat.\u00a0The animal was later released. In another astonishing test set up by BBC Two, a crow called 007 completed an eight stage puzzle in two and a half minutes. It is one of the most complex tests of the animal mind ever devised.",
    "summary": "training aid can be used to collect coins in return for peanuts. crow box training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins. crows have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old. a device called the crow box could make money from their hobby. the box is similar to a vending machine for birds."

    "document": "A bridesmaid hanged herself just hours after her sister's wedding, an inquest has heard. Rebecca Darnell, 30, was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress when she was found dead at her home in Addlestone, Surrey  after the ceremony in November last year. Ms Darnell, known to her family as 'Boo', was described as having been 'the life and soul of the party' at her older sister, Joanna's, wedding. But the coroner was told she had a row with her partner of four years, Carlo Salamone, in a taxi on the way home from the party. Mr Salamone told the inquest he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell to marry her this summer. Rebecca Darnell (right) hanged herself hours after her sister Jo's (second right) wedding . Mr Salamone slept on the sofa when they got home and later went upstairs to find her dead, the inquest heard. She was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress and jewellery from the night before. Her family members told of their shock, having seen Ms Darnell enjoying herself only hours earlier at the wedding in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. Her father David told the coroner: 'She was the life and soul. She got everybody up and dancing, which is no mean feat. She was getting everyone involved.' Her aunt, Jacqueline Nash, said Rebecca was a 'happy, bubbly' person, who had recently organised her sister's Joanna's hen party and was excited to see her get married to fianc\u00e9 Matt Wilson. 'She was always fun to be around so you always tried to see Boo when you could,' she said. 'She had a real zest for life and everyone wanted to know her.' Toxicology tests taken after her death showed she was double the drink driving limit, with 162mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. Mr Salamone said his partner had been 'very happy' on the day of the wedding, on November 8 2013, and, although she had drunk vodka and cola, had not seemed excessively drunk. Taxi driver Khalik Meah said the couple had been arguing when he gave them a lift back from the party some time after midnight. Asked whether the couple rowed a lot, Mr Salamone said they would argue when they were drunk, but this was only around once a month and this had been no worse than normal. Mr Salamone told the inquest in Woking, Surrey that he had met Ms Darnell in around 2010 through a close friend who worked with her at Alpha Hospital in Woking, Surrey. Ms Darnell (right) pictured in the bridesmaid's dress in which she was found dead after her sister's wedding last November . Carlo\u00a0Salamone (pictured with his sister Mirella Newman-Bale, who also gave evidence at today's hearing) told the inquest that he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell, his partner of four years, to marry him this summer . She was juggling work as a youth counsellor specialising in substance abuse with studying for a Masters degree in family therapy. 'She was my life partner,' the garage owner said. 'That evening at the wedding I had spoken to Jo's husband and arranged the following summer in Dubai [where the newlyweds lived] to ask Rebecca to marry me. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.' However, he added: 'Rebecca was very good at making everyone feel better. She often had this iron curtain around her. She would never show people her feelings.' The counsellor had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was aged 25 years, the coroner heard, leaving her reliant on insulin to regulate her blood sugar levels. Her medication had made her put on weight, which Mr Salamone said she worried about, weighing herself every morning and evening. Once, during a severe hypoglycaemic attack, she fell into a coma which lasted four days and left her with minor memory problems. Her father David said his daughter, who grew up in Hertford before the family moved to Guildford, Surrey, had been a perfectionist. He said: 'She set herself high standards, she had aspirations. She wanted to succeed and as a family I think we are all very determined and she had those attributes.' She had found her diabetes diagnoses 'difficult,' he said, coming quite late in her life, but insisted she had it 'all in hand.' 'We're not really sure that she did totally,' he added. Ms Darnell (pictured, third from right) had been head bridesmaid at the wedding of her sister Jo and her husband Matt Wilson. Family had described her as the 'life and soul of the party' at the event . Earlier last year, Ms Darnell organised her sister's hen party. Family said they could not explain her actions . Mr Salamone's sister Mirella Newman-Bale said saw the young woman crying by the bar at one point in the evening, when confided her worries about work and study. The pair made plans to see each other the next day to talk about things. Rebecca's cousin Samantha Nash, aged 24 years, said she had seen Ms Darnell in a state at about 10pm on the night of the wedding. Miss Nash said she made plans to see her cousin the following week for dinner to catch up properly and fetched her mother to check on her. However, the head bridesmaid later perked up and started dancing again and the upset seemed to be over, the inquest heard. The coroner heard that Ms Darnell started working at Visions, a young person's drug and alcohol service in Hounslow, London, in 2011. Records showed her caseload had not increased in the months before her death and she was a valued member of the team, providing vital support to young people with substance abuse problems. Her line manager Luke Hedge said Rebecca had been a 'natural giver and supporter of others.' Offering his sympathies to her parents and partner, coroner Richard Travers said Rebecca had been a 'remarkable force.' 'It is really apparent to me that she was a remarkable force with an exceptional ability to engage with young people,' he said. 'I have absolutely no doubt that she will be a great loss to that line of work. 'On a personal note she was diagnosed with diabetes in 2006, which it seems, was something that sat very heavily with her and which she never came to terms with.

    "document": "A bridesmaid hanged herself just hours after her sister's wedding, an inquest has heard. Rebecca Darnell, 30, was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress when she was found dead at her home in Addlestone, Surrey  after the ceremony in November last year. Ms Darnell, known to her family as 'Boo', was described as having been 'the life and soul of the party' at her older sister, Joanna's, wedding. But the coroner was told she had a row with her partner of four years, Carlo Salamone, in a taxi on the way home from the party. Mr Salamone told the inquest he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell to marry her this summer. Rebecca Darnell (right) hanged herself hours after her sister Jo's (second right) wedding . Mr Salamone slept on the sofa when they got home and later went upstairs to find her dead, the inquest heard. She was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress and jewellery from the night before. Her family members told of their shock, having seen Ms Darnell enjoying herself only hours earlier at the wedding in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. Her father David told the coroner: 'She was the life and soul. She got everybody up and dancing, which is no mean feat. She was getting everyone involved.' Her aunt, Jacqueline Nash, said Rebecca was a 'happy, bubbly' person, who had recently organised her sister's Joanna's hen party and was excited to see her get married to fianc\u00e9 Matt Wilson. 'She was always fun to be around so you always tried to see Boo when you could,' she said. 'She had a real zest for life and everyone wanted to know her.' Toxicology tests taken after her death showed she was double the drink driving limit, with 162mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. Mr Salamone said his partner had been 'very happy' on the day of the wedding, on November 8 2013, and, although she had drunk vodka and cola, had not seemed excessively drunk. Taxi driver Khalik Meah said the couple had been arguing when he gave them a lift back from the party some time after midnight. Asked whether the couple rowed a lot, Mr Salamone said they would argue when they were drunk, but this was only around once a month and this had been no worse than normal. Mr Salamone told the inquest in Woking, Surrey that he had met Ms Darnell in around 2010 through a close friend who worked with her at Alpha Hospital in Woking, Surrey. Ms Darnell (right) pictured in the bridesmaid's dress in which she was found dead after her sister's wedding last November . Carlo\u00a0Salamone (pictured with his sister Mirella Newman-Bale, who also gave evidence at today's hearing) told the inquest that he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell, his partner of four years, to marry him this summer . She was juggling work as a youth counsellor specialising in substance abuse with studying for a Masters degree in family therapy. 'She was my life partner,' the garage owner said. 'That evening at the wedding I had spoken to Jo's husband and arranged the following summer in Dubai [where the newlyweds lived] to ask Rebecca to marry me. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.' However, he added: 'Rebecca was very good at making everyone feel better. She often had this iron curtain around her. She would never show people her feelings.' The counsellor had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was aged 25 years, the coroner heard, leaving her reliant on insulin to regulate her blood sugar levels. Her medication had made her put on weight, which Mr Salamone said she worried about, weighing herself every morning and evening. Once, during a severe hypoglycaemic attack, she fell into a coma which lasted four days and left her with minor memory problems. Her father David said his daughter, who grew up in Hertford before the family moved to Guildford, Surrey, had been a perfectionist. He said: 'She set herself high standards, she had aspirations. She wanted to succeed and as a family I think we are all very determined and she had those attributes.' She had found her diabetes diagnoses 'difficult,' he said, coming quite late in her life, but insisted she had it 'all in hand.' 'We're not really sure that she did totally,' he added. Ms Darnell (pictured, third from right) had been head bridesmaid at the wedding of her sister Jo and her husband Matt Wilson. Family had described her as the 'life and soul of the party' at the event . Earlier last year, Ms Darnell organised her sister's hen party. Family said they could not explain her actions . Mr Salamone's sister Mirella Newman-Bale said saw the young woman crying by the bar at one point in the evening, when confided her worries about work and study. The pair made plans to see each other the next day to talk about things. Rebecca's cousin Samantha Nash, aged 24 years, said she had seen Ms Darnell in a state at about 10pm on the night of the wedding. Miss Nash said she made plans to see her cousin the following week for dinner to catch up properly and fetched her mother to check on her. However, the head bridesmaid later perked up and started dancing again and the upset seemed to be over, the inquest heard. The coroner heard that Ms Darnell started working at Visions, a young person's drug and alcohol service in Hounslow, London, in 2011. Records showed her caseload had not increased in the months before her death and she was a valued member of the team, providing vital support to young people with substance abuse problems. Her line manager Luke Hedge said Rebecca had been a 'natural giver and supporter of others.' Offering his sympathies to her parents and partner, coroner Richard Travers said Rebecca had been a 'remarkable force.' 'It is really apparent to me that she was a remarkable force with an exceptional ability to engage with young people,' he said. 'I have absolutely no doubt that she will be a great loss to that line of work. 'On a personal note she was diagnosed with diabetes in 2006, which it seems, was something that sat very heavily with her and which she never came to terms with. 'It is also apparent to me that there were issues in her personal life which caused her stress and anxiety - her partner, family, work life - but there is nothing that specifically assists me in Boo's intentions on the day she died.

    "document": "(CNN)Modern women are suffering from an energy crisis. Competing in the workplace, caring for aging parents and trying teenagers, and busier than ever, we use anything we can to duct-tape our lives and ourselves together: comfort foods, alcohol, energy drinks, and an expanding array of antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, painkillers and amphetamines. All in an effort to maintain our unnatural pace. Welcome to the increasingly altered states of America. Americans are about 5% of the world's population, yet we take half its pills, and 80% of its painkillers.This over-medication has led to record numbers of opiate overdoses and also to a growing number of women taking antidepressants -- one out of four and counting, according to a report issued by the pharmacy benefit manager, Medco. This is creating a \"new normal,\" bringing closer the tipping point for when other women will seek chemical assistance. Like steroids in baseball, when everyone starts doing it, the players who don't are at a disadvantage. The overuse of psychiatric medication is called cosmetic psychopharmacology, and it's like cosmetic surgery: as more women get breast implants, the rest of us feel flat chested. But the new normal isn't normal at all. Certain antidepressants called SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) create artificially stable and elevated levels of serotonin, the brain chemical that helps regulate mood, which can dampen empathy and emotional reactivity, while higher doses can engender apathy. Women are naturally moody. Our moods change, and this emotional fluidity helps us to be adaptable and resilient. We are dynamic and responsive to our environment. There is a biological advantage to this sensitivity; we need to know what our nonverbal babies need, what our mates are thinking and to sense danger in our surroundings. Moodiness -- being sensitive, caring deeply and occasionally being acutely dissatisfied -- is actually a natural source of power. It helps to ensure not only our survival, but that of our offspring. Women's emotionality is a sign of health, not disease, and it is our single biggest psychological asset. Yet many of us are being convinced to medicate it away. The pharmaceutical industry spends billions in payments to physicians and direct to consumer advertising. Nine out of 10 pharmaceutical companies spend less on research and development than marketing.Steady doses of antidepressant advertising aimed at women advance the question from \"Should I take an antidepressant?\" to \"Which one should I take?\" These medications can have more far-reaching effects than most people realize, blunting empathy, passion, and sensitivity. SSRIs dampen sexual desire and response, making it difficult to climax and interfering with the evaluation of potential romantic partners. SSRIs also make it hard to cry, an important signal to ourselves and those around us that something is very wrong. Tears, and the emotions beneath them, can offer a profound lesson in how people's behavior affects others. We cry when we're touched by the poignancy of humanity, or when we're angry, or frustrated by injustice. And yet, women apologize for their tears, especially in the workplace, where we've been socialized to shut down expressed emotion; it interferes with our typical agenda of forward-momentum, and it makes people uncomfortable. The problem with shutting it down is that we're stifling a piece that we need, that our partners and families need, and that society needs, particularly as women continue to ascend to the upper reaches of business and government. The world needs more compassion, sensitivity, intuition and empathy. War, rape, murder, and corporate malignancy will flourish in their absence. Change comes from discomfort -- and awareness that something is wrong. Sadness and fear are not always symptoms to be medicated. Anxiety and tension come foremost from the denial of emotions, from their repression. My patients want to feel better, but really what many of them need is to get better at feeling. The shame that for centuries has been used by our culture to separate men from their true feelings is now spreading to women, who, by their biology, are the last and much needed connection to this natural place. As we embrace new technologies, we need to be careful that we don't go too far away from nature and what's natural for us as social primates. We insist on all natural products in our baby food and household cleaners. Why don't we insist on natural moods for ourselves? If we can live in a way that is more aligned to what is genuine for us, we will be calmer, more at peace and more fulfilled. But we are drowning in artificiality. There is a \"plastic vortex\" of garbage the size of Texas floating in the Pacific Ocean, synthetic fillers in our breasts and faces, virtual sex partners on our computers and artificially enhanced rationality from serotonergic antidepressants. We compulsively consume this fakery without satiation or satisfaction, because it is impossible to fill up on something that is almost enough. We need a course correction, away from the synthetic, so that we can live lives that honor how we feel. But to do that, we must be able to feel, to be our moody, authentic selves. That is the first step to wellness and to wholeness. Medicating yourself into complacency may leave you unshaken, but it also may leave you unfeeling and apathetic, making it impossible to address the causes of your pain.

    "document": "(CNN)The man who attacked a security area at the New Orleans airport with a machete and wasp spray also had a bag of Molotov cocktails and a car containing smoke bombs and gas cylinders, authorities said. The suspect, Richard White, 63, died Saturday after treatment for three bullet wounds he suffered when a sheriff's lieutenant fired at him to halt the Friday night attack, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said. Sheriff Newell Normand said earlier that investigators hadn't been able to talk to White, who officials said suffered from some type of mental illness. He said White's wife and children had been very cooperative. Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was back open and fully operational, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said. He praised security officials for acting quickly and heroically and doing everything they could to stop the attack. The incident began when White, carrying a bag, entered one of the lanes at the security checkpoint for Concourse B and began spraying Transportation Security Administration agents and bystanders with a can of wasp spray, the sheriff's office said. He then pulled a machete from his waistband and began swinging it at agents and others in the area. \"What I saw originally was one of the officers getting sprayed with the wasp spray,\" said TSA agent Carol Richel, whose arm was hit by one of the bullets fired at White. The officer being sprayed with wasp spray picked up a bag and threw it at White to slow him down, but the suspect still barged through, Richel told reporters. Richel, who was not armed, yelled for everyone to run as she made her way toward the sheriff's lieutenant, who she knew had a weapon. \"I was calling, 'Run, run' for them to get away from him, and I was calling for the (lieutenant) so she was there and alert,\" Richel said. \"I didn't hear him say anything,\" she said. \"Once I yelled for the checkpoint to be cleared, I looked over my shoulder and he was coming after me. And I ran as fast as I could and thank God the officer was as close as she was, because I wouldn't be here today.\" She said the man came \"within inches\" of whacking her with the machete. \"This man was swinging very hard, very hard with that machete,\" Richel said. \"And if he would have made contact with anybody, it would have been terrible.\" Normand said Lt. Heather Slyve fired three shots, ultimately stopping the attacker. He said investigators believe it was the first shot that went through Richel's upper right arm. Richel showed off a bright pink bandage on her arm and said the bullet went through her tricep. \"Originally, I thought the machete hit me. I didn't realize it was a bullet,\" she said. \"I knew he was close, so I honestly thought he hit me and she shot him.\" When White approached the checkpoint, he was carrying a bag that he dropped as soon as the first agent confronted him, Normand said. \"What the bag revealed was six half-pint mason jars with cloth wicks into a liquid that we now know to be gasoline -- what you would commonly refer to as a Molotov cocktail,\" Normand said. A grill lighter and plastic letter opener were also in the bag, and next to his body investigators found powdery material and wicks, which they determined were from crushed smoke bombs. \"The fact that he ended up dropping the bag (when) the TSA agent threw an item at him was huge in the short 40-second span ... of this event,\" Normand said. \"Had he been able to hold onto the bag, he might not have continued to chase the TSA agents through the checkpoint. He might have gone somewhere else.\" The bomb squad found more smoke bombs in his car, and in the trunk were three gas tanks -- one for Freon, one for oxygen and one for acetylene, a compressed gas used in welding and metal-cutting. Normand said their intended purpose wasn't clear. Normand said \"there is a mental illness component\" in their investigation of the suspect. \"No one at this point in time has any notion about what may have triggered this behavior,\" Normand said. \"And not unlike dealing with the mentally ill, sometimes you will never know what actually triggers some of this type of behavior.\" People who had recently interacted with White described him as very cordial, calm, cool and collected, Normand said. They reported having no suspicions about him and said nothing seemed out of the ordinary. It wasn't clear why White was at the airport. Contrary to earlier reports, Normand said Saturday, White was no longer a taxi driver. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo, Joe Sutton, Tony Marco and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.",

Messi was mesmerising in last week's Champions League last 16 tie at the Nou Camp, and the Manchester United midfielder says watching the world's best player at the top of his game made him emotional. Herrera also revealed that captain Wayne Rooney is the joker inside United's dressing room, but admitted that he has to keep the conversation away from boxing, for fears Rooney might hit him. Ander Herrera, one of Manchester United's star players on Sunday, tackles Liverpool's Adam Lallana . Herrera says watching Lionel Messi against Manchester City almost made him cry with joy . The Manchester United midfielder says he needed time to adapt to life at United, because he is 'earthly' 'The last time I cried?' he said, when asked in an interview with Spanish paper El Pais. 'I almost cried watching Messi against Man City. He's so good! But anyway, I get emotional very easily. But hey, I get excited easily and not only with the major teams. I'm a classic man and I was delighted when we played vs Yeovil Town in front of 8,000 standing people yelling at me: \"Who are you?\" 'There's only one Messi and one Ronaldo, where the club must adapt to them. The rest of players are earthly so I must adapt to United.' Herrera also made reference in the interview to the recent scandal involving United captain Rooney, who was videoed boxing in his house with former team-mate Phil Bardsley. Herrera was asked about the sense of humour in the dressing room, and said it is better with Spanish players . Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney insults the Spaniards in their own language, according to Herrera . 'The jokes here are different,' said Herrera. 'Rooney is outgoing and insults us in Spanish. I'd rather talk to him about football because he likes boxing and could try it with me.' However, he was also clear that respect for Rooney is high, insisting that 'I just listen to Rooney and Carrick before games'. 'There is a lot of respect for Rooney and Carrick,who spent many years here, because you see that it is very difficult to do. 'But David De Gea says the dressing room used to be more hierarchic with Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs.' Herrera says Michael Carrick is one of the main leaders in the Manchester United dressing room . The Manchester United star, who played a beautiful pass to Juan Mata for his side's first goal on Sunday at Anfield, also praised English football for the patience of its fans, and the high standard of refereeing. 'The Premier League is the best place to succeed because people are patient. In Spain there's more stir around you from press or fans. 'There's a lot of respect for referees in England. Now I thank (former Athletic Bilbao manager Marcelo) Bielsa for telling me referees are a helpful instrument for football.' Herrera, who scored against Yeovil in the FA Cup, compared the game to Barcelona's Champions League tie .",

    "document": "The mother of an infant found dead near the Sacramento River in Northern California has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and abusing or endangering the health of a child. Samantha Green, 23, of Woodland made her first court appearance Wednesday. Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig announced the charges against Green who was arrested Saturday in the death of her 20-day-old son Justice Rees. Samantha Green (above in court), whose 20-day-old son was found dead near the Sacramento River in Northern California, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and abusing or endangering the health of a child . The charges also include an enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury on a child under age five during the commission of a felony. The boy's body was found with no obvious signs of trauma last week in a swampy area. Sheriff's investigators said he may have died from drowning or hypothermia near the rural town of Knights Landing, about 30 miles west of Sacramento. Green, who had been reported missing with her son on Monday, was found a day earlier looking disheveled and bruised. She told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted, but police have said they do not believe her story. Despite the charges, Green's family said they are standing by her. Police found the body of 20-day-old Justice Rees (right) in swampy land near the Sacramento River after he and Green (left) were reported missing . Green, pictured above at court, told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted. Police have said they do not believe her story . 'Our family is grieving not only for the loss of our grandson Justice, but also the possible loss of our daughter Sami Green,' Green's parents, Randy and Laurie, said in a statement released on Sunday morning and shared by\u00a0CBS. 'She has never been in trouble with the law. We know in our heart that Sami would never do anything to intentionally harm her newborn son Justice. She loved him very much. 'Her entire family supports her through this most unbelievable time in our lives.' Green was reported missing last Monday after she failed to visit her father, Randy, on Saturday February 21, as planned. Her partner Frank Rees posted on Facebook on Tuesday begging Green to come home with their son. 'If anyone sees my beautiful fianc\u00e9 [sic] please tell her that EVERYONE is worried sick about her and Justice,' he wrote. 'We love you Samantha. Just come home babe. I miss you and our son sooooo much. Whatever it is you want different we can fix. I love you momma.' Her partner Frank Rees (right), who is also Justice's father, is supporting Green (left; right with Rees) Crews looked through the Ridge Cut Slough for hours before finding Justice's body, which Green said was in the water . Later that day, she called police to say she had been abducted with her son and that the boy was missing. Passerby Ricardo Villase\u00f1or then came upon Green, wet and shouting for help near the Ridge Cut slough,\u00a0News 10 reported. Villase\u00f1or said although Green seemed disoriented, she explained to him she and the baby had been abducted in town, but that she had no idea how she'd wound up next to the river. 'She was badly bruised,' he said. 'She had no shoes. She was kind of left for dead, it seemed like.' She told him she knew her baby had frozen to death, and though\u00a0she said she didn't know exactly where he was, she said he was somewhere in the slough. Green was admitted to Woodland Hospital and was later released. She was then arrested and charged with murder. After her arrest, Yolo County Sheriff Ed Prieto said: 'We have come to the conclusion that Mrs. Green was the sole individual responsible for the death of her child.'",

    "document": "Families reacted with fury yesterday at learning that Tony Blair will attend a service honouring soldiers killed in Afghanistan. They say the former prime minister has blood on his hands after sending their sons to war and should be facing an inquiry instead. Mr Blair and his successor Gordon Brown will be among the 2,000-strong congregation at a commemoration service at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London. Meet the troops: Tony Blair poses with British forces in 2003 after he took the country to war in Iraq . Politicians, royalty, military chiefs and serving soldiers are on the guest list. But fewer than half of the 2,000 places have been given to the families of the 453 war dead \u2013 who are limited to two seats each. Relatives said it was \u2018horrific\u2019 that Mr Blair and Mr Brown should have a place, while many family members of those who died did not. Bob Wright, 68, whose son Corporal Mark Wright was killed in an unmarked minefield in September 2006, said: \u2018He (Tony Blair) is the last person I would want to see. He would have some cheek going. He took the country to war, and cost all of those lives and he\u2019s got blood on his hands.\u2019 Grandmother Joan Humphreys, 70, said it was \u2018horrific\u2019 Mr Blair had been invited but she had not. Explosion: Private\u00a0Kevin Elliott was killed by a bomb in Afghanistan in 2009 at the age of 24 . The pensioner, whose 24-year-old grandson Kevin Elliott was killed by a bomb in Afghanistan in 2009, added: \u2018Kevin was my grandson, we were very close and I haven\u2019t been invited but Tony Blair has. \u2018I know mothers who haven\u2019t been invited and he just simply shouldn\u2019t have a place.\u2019 Another guest, Ian Sadler, said Gordon Brown should not have been invited either. Mr Sadler said his 21-year-old son Jack was in a vehicle that had inadequate armour when he was killed by a roadside bomb in 2007, while Mr Brown was PM. He said: \u2018I\u2019m hoping Gordon Brown doesn\u2019t stand up and say anything because he has lots of questions to answer.\u2019 Roadside bomb: Jack Sadler was in a vehicle that had inadequate armour when he was killed by a roadside bomb in 2007 . Mr Blair sent troops to Afghanistan to oust the Taliban and kill Osama Bin Laden following the September 11 attacks in 2001. But the decision sparked widespread condemnation after the war dragged on for 13 years and led to hundreds of British deaths. There was outrage when he sent UK troops to Iraq in 2003. Gordon Brown took over as Prime Minister in 2007, with the last of Britain\u2019s troops withdrawing from Iraq in 2011 and Afghanistan by the end of 2014.

    "document": "The NFL have fined the Atlanta Falcons and stripped them of a draft pick  following the team's use of fake crowd noise at home games. In a statement released on Monday, the league announced that the Falcons have been fined $350,000 (\u00a3237,000)\u00a0and will forfeit their fifth-round selection in the 2016 draft. If the Falcons have multiple picks in that round, the highest selection will be forfeited. Team president Rich McKay has also been suspended from the league's Competition Committee beginning April 1. Atlanta Falcons have been fined \u00a3237,000 for their use of fake crowd noise at the Georgia Dome . Owner Arthur Blank acknowledged the team's wrongdoing and described the incident as embarrassing . The NFL noted throughout the 2013 season and into the 2014 season the Falcons violated league rules that state 'at no point during the game can artificial crowd noise or amplified crowd noise be played in the stadium.' The league also said Roddy White, the team's former director of event marketing, was directly responsible for the violation and would have been suspended without pay for the first eight weeks of the 2015 regular season had he still been with the club. The Falcons fired him. The league determined that Falcons ownership and senior executives, including McKay, were unaware of the use of an audio file with artificial crowd noise. But as the senior club executive overseeing game operations, McKay bears some responsibility for ensuring that team employees comply with league rules. McKay can petition Commissioner Roger Goodell for reinstatement to the committee no sooner than June 30. The Falcons played fake crowd noise during the 2013 and 2014 seasons . Falcons president Rick McKay has been suspended from his position on NFL Competition Committee . Falcons owner Arthur Blank said in early February that he had seen enough of the NFL's investigation to acknowledge wrongdoing by his club. 'It's not really a fine line,' Blank said. 'I think what we've done in 2013 and 2014 was wrong. Anything that affects the competitive balance and fairness on the field, we're opposed to, as a league, as a club and as an owner. It's obviously embarrassing but beyond embarrassing it doesn't represent our culture and what we're about.' The Falcons say 101 of 103 games have been sellouts since Blank bought the team in 2002.

    "document": "A 28-year-old woman who was diagnosed with cancer and given a thirty per cent chance of survival has died just days after her marrying her \u2018best friend\u2019. Brittney Ross Brewer, from Windham, Maine, feared she wouldn't make it till her February 27 nuptials, so she officially married Jared Brewer, 31, on Valentine's Day in the chapel at the Maine Medical Center where she was being treated for her aggressive small cell cervical cancer nine months after her diagnosis. But the newlyweds also decided to keep their original wedding date in hopes that Brittney would be able to celebrate with her family and friends one last time - and she did. True love: Brittney Ross Brewer, 28, from Windham, Maine, celebrated her wedding to\u00a0Jared Brewer, 31, during their reception last Friday - nearly a year after she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer . Perfect pair: Brittney and Jared shared a kiss at their celebration. Only days later the beautiful bride died surrounded by her loved ones . But just two days after their reception, Brittney died surrounded by her loved ones who had gathered to watch her wedding video with her. 'She still wanted to have a big party to celebrate life and see everybody for probably the last time, unfortunately,' Jared told People of their wedding, which was attended by nearly 200 guests. A photographer captured the couple's entire celebration, including their tender kisses and the moments Brittney spent with her family as she got ready. For her special day, Brittney wore a white gown and cowboy boots, while her bridesmaids surprised her by performing a line dance they had learned. Jared's sister Janessa Brewer shared the sad news of Brittney's passing on Facebook yesterday. Family ties: Janessa Brewer gave her brother and her new sister-in-law a loving look at the reception . Full of fight: The couple officially married on February 14, but kept their original wedding date in hopes that Brittney would be able to celebrate with the nearly 200 guests she had invited to their party . Bittersweet: Jared helped Brittney cut their cake during their wedding celebration . Tender moment: Jared wrapped his arms around his new wife, who wore a white lace dress and cowboy boots to their reception . 'While Brittney may not have won her battle with cancer, she will live on forever within our hearts!' she wrote. 'Jared was able to give her the wedding of her dreams and she enjoyed every minute of it! Brittney was a living, breathing angel... who now has her wings!' Brittney and Jared, who met while working for the Corrections Department in Portland, started dating in April 2012. Jared proposed to her on June 28, 2014, a month after she was diagnosed with cancer. 'The cancer only opened our eyes to how short life can be and how we shouldn\u2019t waste any moments,' Brittney wrote on her blog. 'So we decided not to.'

She continued: 'He pulled out the most perfect and beautiful ring, asked me to marry him, and I said: \"Yes.\"' They planned on getting married this August in hopes that she would be in remission, but after learning that her cancer had spread to her liver, they brought their wedding date forward to February. Friends and family donated their time and money to assure Brittney and Jared would have as much time together as they could. Even members of the local police and fire departments offered her their sick time so that Brittney could continue to get paid for another year-and-a-half, while one of Jared's co-worker sold t-shirts to help raise them money. Saying I do: Brittney and Jared kissed during their official ceremony\u00a0on Valentine's Day in the chapel at the Maine Medical Center where she was being treated . Normal couple: Brittney and Jared, who started dating in April 2012, enjoyed a night out together after their engagement . Happy times: Brittney shared this selfie on her Facebook page a month before she was diagnosed with cancer . Janessa even created a GoFundMe page to pay for Brittney's medical expenses, which has reached $7,000 of her $10,000 goal. And people continue to donate to the page following the news of her death. After her February 14 wedding ceremony, Brittney shared her gratitude for her family and friends on her blog. 'It\u2019s been such a true blessing these past few days to see my friends and family coming together this past week for me...' she wrote. 'Making sure I got to marry my best friend and spend time with everyone I can.' 'Makes a girl appreciate how truly loved she is,' she added. Unfortunately not everyone wins their battle with cancer... Brittney put up one hell of a fight but this disease was aggressive and rare. The doctors were nothing but exceptional when it came to fighting back... They did everything in their power to stop the progression of her cancer... But God wanted her in the worst way. The disease overpowered her body to the point of fatality. 10 months is all the time the cancer allowed her to have.. These 10 months have had their share of ups and downs but Brittney never let anyone see her pain. She was always the most upbeat and positive person.

Friends and family donated their time and money to assure Brittney and Jared would have as much time together as they could. Even members of the local police and fire departments offered her their sick time so that Brittney could continue to get paid for another year-and-a-half, while one of Jared's co-worker sold t-shirts to help raise them money. Saying I do: Brittney and Jared kissed during their official ceremony\u00a0on Valentine's Day in the chapel at the Maine Medical Center where she was being treated . Normal couple: Brittney and Jared, who started dating in April 2012, enjoyed a night out together after their engagement . Happy times: Brittney shared this selfie on her Facebook page a month before she was diagnosed with cancer . Janessa even created a GoFundMe page to pay for Brittney's medical expenses, which has reached $7,000 of her $10,000 goal. And people continue to donate to the page following the news of her death. After her February 14 wedding ceremony, Brittney shared her gratitude for her family and friends on her blog. 'It\u2019s been such a true blessing these past few days to see my friends and family coming together this past week for me...' she wrote. 'Making sure I got to marry my best friend and spend time with everyone I can.' 'Makes a girl appreciate how truly loved she is,' she added. Unfortunately not everyone wins their battle with cancer... Brittney put up one hell of a fight but this disease was aggressive and rare. The doctors were nothing but exceptional when it came to fighting back... They did everything in their power to stop the progression of her cancer... But God wanted her in the worst way. The disease overpowered her body to the point of fatality. 10 months is all the time the cancer allowed her to have.. These 10 months have had their share of ups and downs but Brittney never let anyone see her pain. She was always the most upbeat and positive person. While Brittney may not have won her battle with cancer, she will live on forever within our hearts! Jared was able to give her the wedding of her dreams and she enjoyed every minute of it! Brittney was a living, breathing angel... who now has her wings! We love you sweet girl! Rest in peace dear sister, you have taught me so much about life, I cannot express the gratitude I have towards you, you will never be forgotten! Always and forever in our hearts... - J .",

    "document": "The man accused of using Facebook to lure a teenager to her death confessed the murder to his ex-girlfriend, according to testimony she gave in court on Monday. Kyle Dube, 21, of Orono, Maine, is accused of using a phony social media account to kidnap 15-year-old Nichole Cable, of Glenburn, and kill her in May 2013. The Bangor Daily News\u00a0reports that Dube's ex-girlfriend Sarah Mersinger testified Monday that he told her he killed Nichole. Mersinger says Dube covered up Nichole's body with leaves and sticks. During an emotional testimony, she added: 'He told me that he strangled her at the end of her road. He said he put duct tape on her mouth, her eyes and on her hands and feet. Elaborate plot? Kyle Dube, 21, (pictured left in court last week) allegedly abducted Nichole Cable, 15, (right) in 2013 so that he could stage a rescue and be hailed as a hero. His ex-girlfriend has told a court he confessed to killing her and dumping her body in woodland in Bangor, Maine . 'He said he took her clothes off so the police dogs couldn\u2019t smell her.\u00a0He said he covered her with sticks and leaves, so they couldn\u2019t see her from the sky.' The court heard Mersinger would spend 18 or 19 days out of 21 at the house Dube shared with his parents and a four-year-old daughter from another relationship. Mersinger also told the jury that she had met Dube on Facebook, where they began messaging each other. They began dating in November 2012 but her mother didn\u2019t approve . Prosecutors say DNA evidence ties Dube to Nichole's disappearance. His attorneys say someone else killed the high school sophomore. Dube is pleading not guilty to abduction and murder, arguing that somebody else committed the crimes. During a court hearing last week, it was alleged Dube was intending to abduct her then stage a fake rescue so he could be hailed as a hero. According to the prosecution, the bogus account was traced to his home, his DNA was found on a hat at the end of Nichole's driveway and cell tower records show that he was in the area of Nichole's home. Accused: Prosecutors say Dube, pictured with his attorney during a hearing last Monday, left a hat with his DNA on it near Nichole's home . Defense attorney Wendy Hatch said last Monday that the state rushed to judge Dube, and she argued that someone else had committed the crimes. 'We are here to show you the state has holes in their case. They have mistakes, big mistakes,' Hatch told the jury, adding that Dube 'got up the next morning, got dressed, kissed his daughter goodbye and went to work.' Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber said Dube's DNA was also found on Cable's fingernails, and he had scratches on his face after she disappeared. He also said Dube alluded to the crime while having an emotional outburst as officers tried to calm him down while he reported to jail for an unrelated traffic offense. 'Dube responded it was what he had done, that they didn't know he had done, that he was worried about,' Macomber said. Horrifying: The court heard Dube (mugshot left) covered Nichole's (right) body in leaves so she couldn't be seen from the sky and took her clothes off so police dogs couldn't smell her . The trial is expected to last two weeks and includes a witness list with more than 80 names. The case prompted discussions about the appropriate use of social media at the high school she attended in Old Town. Nichole's mother, Kristine Wiley, testified that she knew Dube as a friend of her daughter's who came by their house two or three times before her disappearance. Between tears, she testified that Dube reached out to her with an offer to baby-sit her other children after Nichole vanished but before her body was found. Wiley said Dube first told her he had heard Wiley said he was responsible for Nichole's disappearance. Wiley said she denied the accusation and that Dube then told her 'if I needed anything, call' and that he would watch her other children for her. She said she never took him up on the offer.

May-Treanor hasn't been seen at the gym since October, a month before it's official opening and since then parents have been getting angrier and angrier walking past her perennially empty office. Last month, about 60 parents with kids at the gym met in a nearby park to discuss action. And in a meeting with Rangel, volleyball mom Michelle Peters threatened to stop paying, saying she felt her 15-year-old daughter wasn't getting the advertised program (parents at the facility pay $4,300 for a seven-month season). 'What aren\u2019t you getting?' Rangel asked during the meeting. 'Well, we\u2019re not getting Misty May,' Peters responded. Rangel says most of the malcontent parents came from a club in Mission Viejo and were not happy when their former club director, who moved to work at the MMTSC, resigned over clashes with him. The 155,000-square-foot facility was pitched to May-Treanor by Rangel ahead of the 2012 London Olympics. Rangel wanted to built a state-of-the-art sports facility, while May-Treanor wanted to coach so it made the perfect project for the pair. The finished facility has 22 volleyball courts, 21 basketball courts - all with their own electric scoreboards. The facility also includes an air-conditioned 350-seat restaurant with 10 large HDTVs as an area to watch the games and practices.",
    "summary": "misty may-treanor has reportedly fallen out with longtime trainer mike rangel. the three-time olympic gold medalist's office is empty after a mysterious fallout. now parents are threatening to stop paying their seasonal dues of $ 4,300. the 155,000-square-foot misty may-treanor sports center was opened in november 2014. she was excited to be involved in the club and give back to her local community."

    "document": "Draft legislation aimed at boosting a flagging birth rate threatens to reduce Iranian women to 'baby-making machines' and set their rights back by decades, Amnesty International warned on Wednesday. The London-based human rights group said that a first bill, which has already been approved once by parliament, would restrict access to contraception, forcing women into unsafe backstreet abortions. It said the second draft law, which is to go before parliament next month, would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children. Iran is seeking to double its population to 150 million by 2065 . 'The proposed laws will entrench discriminatory practices and set the rights of women and girls in Iran back by decades,' said Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui. 'The authorities are promoting a dangerous culture in which women are stripped of key rights and viewed as baby-making machines rather than human beings with fundamental rights to make choices about their own bodies and lives.' The draft legislation comes in response to a call by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to double Iran's population to 150 million within 50 years. Iranian officials have expressed alarm at its ageing population, with an official at the national birth registry, Mohammad Nazemi Ardekani, warning last April the population growth rate could fall to zero 'within 30 years'. The bill, which is now undergoing amendment, would ban voluntary sterilisation and end state subsidies for contraceptive services. Draft legislation will put men and women in Iran who can have children to the top of the priority list for jobs . Amnesty said it would inevitably lead to an increase in backstreet terminations in a country where abortion is illegal except in very limited circumstances. The second bill would require both public and private employers to give priority to men and women with children when hiring for certain jobs. It would also make divorce more difficult and restrict intervention by the state in family disputes, which Amnesty said would expose women to increased risks of domestic violence. Women currently make up around 60 percent of university students in Iran and 10 percent of economically active women are employed, according to official figures.",

Footage to be screened this evening on BBC1 focuses on one farm where about 34,000 chickens are penned into a shed with few windows. When they are large enough the chickens are gassed, chopped into nine pieces and sent to warehouses in large trays where they are then distributed to branches nationwide. The farmer in charge claimed the birds had 'a very good life' and showed how they were healthy . Farms supply KFC with around 23 million chickens each year and its chains sell almost 400 pieces of chicken every minute. At one farm around 34,000 chickens are penned into sheds with few windows . About 1,000 farms in the country supply KFC with 23million chickens a year. The programme focuses on a farmer called Andrew who says the chickens at his farm \u2013 left to do nothing but eat and drink until they reach the required weight \u2013 have a good life, saying he \u2018wouldn\u2019t mind being a chicken in here\u2019. Scenes show the chickens as they walk around in their own excrement while a layer of sawdust has turned murky brown from mopping up waste. Asked if he thinks this is a problem, Andrew says: \u2018No, no, no, that\u2019s not a problem at all, because you see here, this is all sawdust, so the idea is to keep this as dry as possible.\u2019 The supplier, who has 35 years\u2019 experience, says: \u2018As you can see, they\u2019ve got beautifully clean feet and that is a good sign that these birds are healthy and they\u2019ve been grown on good litter. You can see this is a good, healthy chicken. I can\u2019t think there\u2019s anything better than being sat in a chicken farm looking at chickens. You can see for yourself, they look absolutely fantastic.\u2019 Asked whether he feels it is a shame their lives end so soon, he says: \u2018No, they probably have a short life but they have a very good life.\u2019 Yesterday animal rights campaigners claimed the lives of the KFC chickens were \u2018oppressive\u2019. Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, said: \u2018These birds have no meaningful life. They endure a wretched existence in giant windowless sheds stinking with ammonia. A very large number die from starvation or dehydration. About 900million of these birds are produced in country each year about 30million-plus die in the sheds. When the chickens are large enough they are gassed, chopped into nine pieces and sent to the warehouses in large trays . The trays of chicken are then distributed to KFC branches nationwide and sold to customers . This is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC. The fast food chain say animal welfare is 'essential' Fast food: One of KFC's branches. KFC say that all their suppliers meet or exceed UK and EU welfare requirements . \u2018Millions of these birds, just like the ones KFC is commissioning to be produced die in sheds wretchedly and painfully every year. \u2018These birds are deprived of everything that makes life worth living. The next step after this is to be grabbed by their frail legs, and shoved in crates and taken off to slaughter.

The farmer in charge claimed the birds had 'a very good life' and showed how they were healthy . Farms supply KFC with around 23 million chickens each year and its chains sell almost 400 pieces of chicken every minute. At one farm around 34,000 chickens are penned into sheds with few windows . About 1,000 farms in the country supply KFC with 23million chickens a year. The programme focuses on a farmer called Andrew who says the chickens at his farm \u2013 left to do nothing but eat and drink until they reach the required weight \u2013 have a good life, saying he \u2018wouldn\u2019t mind being a chicken in here\u2019. Scenes show the chickens as they walk around in their own excrement while a layer of sawdust has turned murky brown from mopping up waste. Asked if he thinks this is a problem, Andrew says: \u2018No, no, no, that\u2019s not a problem at all, because you see here, this is all sawdust, so the idea is to keep this as dry as possible.\u2019 The supplier, who has 35 years\u2019 experience, says: \u2018As you can see, they\u2019ve got beautifully clean feet and that is a good sign that these birds are healthy and they\u2019ve been grown on good litter. You can see this is a good, healthy chicken. I can\u2019t think there\u2019s anything better than being sat in a chicken farm looking at chickens. You can see for yourself, they look absolutely fantastic.\u2019 Asked whether he feels it is a shame their lives end so soon, he says: \u2018No, they probably have a short life but they have a very good life.\u2019 Yesterday animal rights campaigners claimed the lives of the KFC chickens were \u2018oppressive\u2019. Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, said: \u2018These birds have no meaningful life. They endure a wretched existence in giant windowless sheds stinking with ammonia. A very large number die from starvation or dehydration. About 900million of these birds are produced in country each year about 30million-plus die in the sheds. When the chickens are large enough they are gassed, chopped into nine pieces and sent to the warehouses in large trays . The trays of chicken are then distributed to KFC branches nationwide and sold to customers . This is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC. The fast food chain say animal welfare is 'essential' Fast food: One of KFC's branches. KFC say that all their suppliers meet or exceed UK and EU welfare requirements . \u2018Millions of these birds, just like the ones KFC is commissioning to be produced die in sheds wretchedly and painfully every year. \u2018These birds are deprived of everything that makes life worth living. The next step after this is to be grabbed by their frail legs, and shoved in crates and taken off to slaughter.

The search for Noah Thomas, from Dublin, has widened since he was first went missing when his mother decided to get another hour of sleep on Sunday morning.

Noah Thomas, 5, has been missing for two days after last being seen watching cartoons Sunday morning in Dublin, Virginia . Search crews have looked around the boy's house, where his mother saw him at 9am but could not find him after she woke up at 10 . A ground search continued overnight on Sunday and expanded to include more than 100 members of Virginia law enforcement near the boy's home in Pulaski County, according to\u00a0WDBJ. The FBI and Virginia State Police have become involved in the search. Police and more than 100 volunteers who signed up to look for Noah in the small town have covered about 3.3 square miles. Pulaski County Sheriff Jim Davis said that authorities have no evidence of foul play in his disappearance. Investigators said search dogs stopped near the road near Noah's house, which is 'never typical'. No suspicious vehicles were seen in the area. The boy, who helped drop his mother and infant sibling drop his father off at work at 7am, is believed to be wearing a camouflage jacket, black and yellow paints and Spider-Man boots. He may also be wearing a San Diego Chargers jersey with the number 21 on it.

Billy Chrimes, deputy search and rescue coordinator with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, said that the best opportunity to find a missing child is often at night when they stop moving. Lack of food and water and potential problems with wildlife are also concerns, he told the Roanoke Times. Temperatures on Monday night were in the mid-40s.
