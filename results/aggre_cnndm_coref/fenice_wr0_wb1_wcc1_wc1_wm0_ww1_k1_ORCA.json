    "document": "Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large - scale study has found. The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight, the may also be fattening our children. Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics, The researchers said that the widely - prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic. A third of 10 - 11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4 - 5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today' s generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than today ' s generation parents. Obesity: Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large - scale study has found ( file photo) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12, 000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years - old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. Boys were also slightly taller than boys who hadn' t been given the drugs. The study didn' t prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if antibiotics do, it may be because antibiotics kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. kill frees up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: ' Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. ' Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys. ' Epidemic ': By two years - old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight ( file photo) ' An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems. ' The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but antibiotics extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences. ' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The studies come amid growing concern that the over - prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing the pills power and making common infections harder to treat. The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200, 000 Britons and kill 80, 000 in a single outbreak.",

    "document": "Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large - scale study has found. The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight, the may also be fattening our children. Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics, The researchers said that the widely - prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic. A third of 10 - 11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4 - 5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today' s generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than today ' s generation parents. Obesity: Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large - scale study has found ( file photo) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12, 000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years - old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. Boys were also slightly taller than boys who hadn' t been given the drugs. The study didn' t prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if antibiotics do, it may be because antibiotics kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. kill frees up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: ' Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. ' Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys. ' Epidemic ': By two years - old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight ( file photo) ' An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems. ' The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but antibiotics extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences. ' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The studies come amid growing concern that the over - prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing the pills power and making common infections harder to treat. The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200, 000 Britons and kill 80, 000 in a single outbreak.",

On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while the Italian Coast Guard is taking the report seriously, the Italian Coast Guard cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said.

    "document": "First blood to United after Manchester United Under 18s saw off City 1 - 0 in the ' mini - derby '. Kits aside, a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday was probably as far removed from Sunday' s big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick - off were English. Of no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick - off, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free - kick. Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1, 000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half - and - half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham' s compact 6, 000 - capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but Moss Lane does have a proud history of Moss Lane own. Moss Lane was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United' s Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness' s Under 18s usually ply their Under 18s trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what United manager Paul McGuinness tyros could expect should their Under 18s make the step up to the seniors. And United manager Paul McGuinness side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first - half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw United manager Paul McGuinness side claim victory in the ' mini derby ' For the home side towering centre - forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty - footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free - kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart - a - like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full - back Cameron Borthwick - Jackson' s rasping 25 - yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when full - back Cameron Borthwick - Jackson ' s appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side - netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year' s cross - town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury - ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end - of - season play - off series.

    "document": "First blood to United after Manchester United Under 18s saw off City 1 - 0 in the ' mini - derby '. Kits aside, a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday was probably as far removed from Sunday' s big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick - off were English. Of no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick - off, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free - kick. Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1, 000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half - and - half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham' s compact 6, 000 - capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but Moss Lane does have a proud history of Moss Lane own. Moss Lane was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United' s Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness' s Under 18s usually ply their Under 18s trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what United manager Paul McGuinness tyros could expect should their Under 18s make the step up to the seniors. And United manager Paul McGuinness side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first - half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw United manager Paul McGuinness side claim victory in the ' mini derby ' For the home side towering centre - forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty - footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free - kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart - a - like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full - back Cameron Borthwick - Jackson' s rasping 25 - yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when full - back Cameron Borthwick - Jackson ' s appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side - netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year' s cross - town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury - ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end - of - season play - off series.

    "document": "( CNN) SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two - stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. Tuesday ' s launch was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted:\" Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.\" SpaceX founder Elon Musk later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said SpaceX will keep trying and, after SpaceX masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth' s atmosphere or, like NASA' s space shuttle boosters, booster rockets fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On SpaceX founder Elon Musk company' s website, SpaceX founder Elon Musk says that if anyone can figure out how to\" reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred.\" What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth' s atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4, 300 pounds ( 1, 950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. The space station crew' ll then stuff an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon with over 3, 000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When The space station crew' re done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. this mission is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. Tuesday' s launch was the second attempt for this mission. Monday' s planned launch was scrubbed due to weather. CNN' s Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.",

    "document": "( CNN) SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two - stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. Tuesday ' s launch was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted:\" Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.\" SpaceX founder Elon Musk later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said SpaceX will keep trying and, after SpaceX masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth' s atmosphere or, like NASA' s space shuttle boosters, booster rockets fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On SpaceX founder Elon Musk company' s website, SpaceX founder Elon Musk says that if anyone can figure out how to\" reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred.\" What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth' s atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4, 300 pounds ( 1, 950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. The space station crew' ll then stuff an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon with over 3, 000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When The space station crew' re done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. this mission is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. Tuesday' s launch was the second attempt for this mission. Monday' s planned launch was scrubbed due to weather. CNN' s Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.",

Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends northern Iraq' s semi - autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn' t say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate Wednesday ' s release. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent more than 200 Yazidis , a minority group whose members were killed , captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq' s Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn' t immediately clear what motivated Wednesday' s release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis - - largely children and the elderly - - since attacking the group' s towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq' s north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities - - Yazidis among hundreds of thousands of minorities - - from hundreds of thousands of minorities homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and the Yazidis religion is considered a pre - Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism.

Dad Phil has labelled the security checks ' ludicrous ' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation.

Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home - grown players in club squads from eight to 12, however Football Association chairman Greg Dyke is facing opposition from the Premier League. The proposals also include changing the rules so that ' home - grown ' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21. FA chairman Greg Dyke ( left), speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore, wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs. Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven - Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if the English game blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA' s England Commission. ' Graham Taylor , Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Sven - Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren urge everyone in the English game to get behind the proposals from Dyke and the FA ' s England Commission as quickly as possible, ' the letter reportedly says. a letter addressed to Dyke adds: ' Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup. ' Former England managers ( clockwise) Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren and Sven - Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke' s call.

' However, as the England Commission' s evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it' s an undeniable fact that is is a clear disadvantage for any England manager. ' The rise of Harry Kane ( centre) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters.

The untried Barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick \u2013 awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon \u2013 rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. Although there was no dispute between the team - mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton' s match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed. Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch. Barkley' s effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park. Martinez insisted Barkley was within Ross Barkley rights to request penalty - taking duties on Saturday. ' If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch, Romelu Lukaku would have taken the 10th minute kick \u2013 awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon \u2013. Otherwise, Everton manager Roberto Martinez am happy to have three or four players who can take penalties and let it depend on how three or four players who can take penalties feel at that moment, ' argued the Everton manager. Baines ( left) has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. ' Ross showed incredible responsibility to take the 10th minute kick \u2013 awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon \u2013.

    "document": "Everton manager Roberto Martinez was forced to defend another penalty fiasco at the club after Ross Barkley missed from the spot in Everton ' s 1 - 0 win against Burnley at Goodison Park. The untried Barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick \u2013 awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon \u2013 rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. Although there was no dispute between the team - mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton' s match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed. Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch. Barkley' s effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park. Martinez insisted Barkley was within Ross Barkley rights to request penalty - taking duties on Saturday. ' If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch, Romelu Lukaku would have taken the 10th minute kick \u2013 awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon \u2013. Otherwise, Everton manager Roberto Martinez am happy to have three or four players who can take penalties and let it depend on how three or four players who can take penalties feel at that moment, ' argued the Everton manager. Baines ( left) has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League.
