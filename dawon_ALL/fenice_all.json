There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday.\nIn an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: \"Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes.\n\"It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity.\"\nThe BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away.\nSpeaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: \"The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde.\n\"Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.\n\"Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).\n\"The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism.\"",

    "document": "It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points.\nThis, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid.\nListen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality\nThe slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine.\nNow, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit.\nThis is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history.\nIn 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races.\nThey dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99.\nAmazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'.\nThey should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari.\nBut although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information.\nThere was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan.\nUntil 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too.\nIn many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline.\nTheir first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970.\nTheir maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda.\nBut then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now.\nSo alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another.\nDennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season.\nSo far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again?\nDennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return.\nIt is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title.\nThis, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007.\nThe Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end.\nDennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too.\nThey can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver \"championships, plural\", as Dennis puts it.\nBut right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",

Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed.\nSo far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker.\n\"There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,\" he says.\n\"The chat room is like the foyer of a church.\"\nVirtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included:\nIts first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons.\n\"We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,\" says Mr Parker.\n\"The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity.\"\nThe Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website.\nGuardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union.\nThe game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release.\n\"Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,\" he says.\n\"The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around.\n\"It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world.\"\nYou get the idea.\nSpecial content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus.\nThere are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits.\nGerman marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times.\nThere are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable.\nThe whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins.\nHighlights include one \"Joseph Carpenter\" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card.\nThe Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times.\n\"It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,\" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network.\n\"The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.\"\nHowever, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being \"too religious\".\nAfter distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language.\nThe book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah.\nIt is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees.\n\"We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,\" says founder Roald Lidal.\n\"One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,\" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years.\n\"There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga.\"\nAs if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year.\n\"I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,\" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier.\n\"The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.\"\n\"Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,\" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex.\n\"He was a great communicator.\"\nSounds like a seal of approval to me.",

Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nA spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny.\n\"All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,\" said Natalia Poplevskaya.\nRamzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them \"lies\". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya.\nThe Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that \"retribution\" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April.\n\"There will be retribution!\" he told the Russian news website RBC. \"Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics.\"\nNovaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters.\nIn an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya.\n\"We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,\" he wrote, urging dialogue.\nChechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova.\nBut much remains unclear about those contract killings, and that of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya.\nThe LGBT Network says it is helping people to flee the persecution in Chechnya and accuses the Russian authorities of ignoring the abuses.\nIf Russia fails to prosecute anyone, it says it will file a case at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.",

    "document": "The former five-weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline.\nThe NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday.\nNAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August.\nLighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing.\nLast week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: \"I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves.\"\nBut the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed.\nAt the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before.\nRules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified.\n\"Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett. \"To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\"\nDuring his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: \"I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands.\"\nThe NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision.\nMcGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin.\nBut Bennett says he studied a \"litany of information\" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were \"several reasons to approve the fight\".\nBennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion.\n\"I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,\" said Bennett. \"He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer.\n\"Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer.\n\"Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself.\n\"That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight.\"\nMcGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier.\nSince sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: \"He's good to go.\"\nHe also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73.\nCortez said he oversaw an \"out of control\" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session.",

    "document": "It is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters.\nIt has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain's own defences.\nFor now though it is the hunt for U33, not Red October. The German U-boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves.\nU33's commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships.\nTheir task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker.\nWhen they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds.\nUp on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search.\nHe says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity.\nThere have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK.\nHe says the training \"focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare\".\nFor the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy.\nIt has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack.\nUp on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope.\nDown below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors.\nLieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship.\nHe says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines.\nBut when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: \"I wouldn't want to comment on that,\" before adding: \"In general, we're always on the lookout.\"\nNato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy.\nBut this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength.\nWhile many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his.\nRussia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters.\nEarlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the \"quietest submarine in the world\".\nPeter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development.\nHe describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled.\nThey are, he says, the \"quietest and most challenging adversary in the world\".\nWhen out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time.\nOften the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves.\nThey lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and \"fingerprinting\" other nations' submarines and warships.\nFor this exercise, curiously named \"Dynamic Mongoose\", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search.\nFor the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean.\nScientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed.\nIt is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea.\nRyan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise.\nThey are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance.\nUnderwater drones are for the future.\nBut for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft.\nThese are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean.\nFor this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft.\nInside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below.\nBritain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences.\nSeveral times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters.\nRUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a \"key vulnerability\".\nHe says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland.\nBritain, he says, should be \"exceptionally worried\" that it is seen as a \"soft touch\", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace.\nThe purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare.\nBut it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone.\nThe lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review.\nThe search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.",

The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage.\nAlessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor \"came out of nowhere\", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - \"medium-strong\" and \"fairly shallow\".\nItaly is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila.\nSix scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement.\nThe group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided \"inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory\" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake.\nAt a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely.\nOn the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.",

The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.\nHowever, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.\nIn parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.\nWhy Jonathan lost?\nBuhari's historic victory\nNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.\nMost of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.\nOn Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.\nIt means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.\nOur correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.\nThe party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.\nIt had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.\nThe PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.",

We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough.\n\"The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight.

    "document": "The network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance, but could eventually encompass more than 2,000.\nThe aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe.\nIn particular, the project wants every school to have a connection.\nBuilding so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus.\nIt can take Europe\u2019s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today\u2019s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost.\nThat means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes.\nThe idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece.\nThe boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy.\n\"Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc.\n\"Here, we\u2019ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,\" he told BBC News.\nAirbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida.\nThe most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the \"revolution\" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan.\nThe first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year.\nAnother batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace.\nThe establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight.\nMore than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth.\nThere should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade.\nOneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage.\nEquity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a \"truly global company\" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority.\n\"A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK,\" said OneWeb CEO Eric B\u00e9ranger.\n\"And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries.\"\nOne aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions.\nThe fear is that space could eventually become unusable.\nA recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other.\nBrian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation.\n\"We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit.\"\nTime will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole.\nAirbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines. But not every platform in the sky will require such volumes and a good number of spacecraft will still need the bespoke treatment.\n\"Not everything here is application to the whole space industry. When we launch to Jupiter, there are things that will remain gold-plated whether we like it or not; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today,\u201d said Nicolas Chamussy, who runs the satellite division of Airbus.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

She is a massive fan.\nEven before the stadium installed its Changing Places toilet, says Bethan, \"There were some nearby in the centre of Cardiff and it made things so much easier whenever we needed to change Lowri\"\nChanging Places specifications have been included in the Building Standards guidelines (BS 8300:2009) since 2009 as a recommendation rather than a compulsory requirement.\nArchitect Vaila Morrison explains why this creates a problem.\n\"By making it compulsory to have a Changing Places toilet in larger complexes then you will give people clarity over what is expected as there is none at the moment,\" she says.\n\"As a designer you tend to focus on what you have to do in line with compulsory legislation and recommendations can be ignored because of this.\"\nFor businesses, especially those in already existing buildings, logistical and financial barriers to installing these toilets can sometimes block plans.\nAt 12 square metres (3m x 4m) Changing Places are considerably larger than the standard accessible toilet (1,5m x 2.2m).\nBecause of this campaigners are focusing their efforts on making it compulsory for newly built larger complexes such as shopping centres, cinemas and sports stadiums in the building regulations.\nArsenal Football Club, who were the first side in the Premier League to install a Changing Places toilet, have seen a very positive reaction not just from fans but from the general public too.\nAlun Francis, Disability Liaison Officer at the club, said: \"There were challenges and despite already having 38 wheelchair accessible toilets we were constrained by the original building design as it existed before the recommendations came in, so we had to adapt.\n\"But working with the people behind the Changing Places group was such a positive experience.\n\"They looked at our ideas to convert two of the existing toilets into one Changing Place and helped us find a way around things so we could make it possible.\n\"You need to think about all of your customers when you run any type of venue and if you want their custom you have to make things accessible for them - it's important.\"",

    "document": "It also warns that Britain may have to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall deal.\nFishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favour of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign.\nThe Lords review says these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations.\nThe EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), with its quotas and principle of equal access to commercial fishing grounds for boats from all member states, has often been characterised by the industry as a disaster for Britain.\nThis dislike helped mobilise many in the industry to campaign for a leave vote in the referendum last June.\nMany in the fishing community argue that Brexit now offers the industry the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation, like Norway.\nHowever, the House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report that looks at the risks and opportunities for the UK industry.\nSince UK fishing only produces a half of one percent of GDP and employs just 12,000 fishers, the Lords say that industry might be a low priority for the government but it \"must not be marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations\".\nWhat complicates the picture is the fact the most commercial fish stocks are in waters that are shared between the UK and other EU coastal states. The vast majority of UK fish are exported, mainly to the EU while a significant proportion of the fish that British consumers eat is imported, often from EU states.\n\"A successful industry,\" the report says, \"therefore needs continued market access.\"\nHowever, that access may come at a price.\n\"Brexit will involve many trade-offs,\" said Lord Teverson who chairs the Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee.\n\"It may very well be that EU member states demand more access to UK waters than some fishers would want in return for our continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs.\"\nThe report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice. The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states.\nOne area of concern, according to the report, may well be that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away \"raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes\" in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nHowever, many in the fishing industry still argue that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats.\nJust this week, the EU announced agreement on new quotas under the CFP - many analysts say that it marked an advance for the UK with significant increases in allowable catches for plaice, haddock and prawns.\nResponding to the new quotas, representatives from the industry said they believed this augurs well for the future of British fishing outside the EU.\n\"With Brexit now looming, fishermen can look to the future with real optimism as we are on the cusp of an exciting new era as a coastal state with full control of our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,\" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said in a statement.\n\"This will give us the opportunity for fairer shares in catching opportunity and better fit-for-purpose sustainable fisheries management, which will benefit our coastal communities.\"\nIn response to the report, a government spokesperson said: \"As we enter the EU negotiations, the prime minister has been clear we want to ensure British companies have the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market.\"\n\"At the same time, leaving the EU is a real opportunity to review fisheries management in order to ensure fair access to quota, sustainable stocks and a healthy marine environment.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook",

In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil.\nThe highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools.\nThe underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them.\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000.\nBut Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results.\nResearchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment.\nBut Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact.\nAnd there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families.\nDr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools.\n\"The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,\" she said.\nA separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read.\nIt showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books.\nThe study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people.\nWithin a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet \"addicts\".\nAbout two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos.\nFindings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children.\nIt showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home.\nSimon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools.\nEach pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home.\nUsing these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in \"the current century and not the last\".\nThe benefits are \"difficult to put into league tables\", he says. But they create a \"sense of empowerment\" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel \"trusted and valued\".\nTablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on.\nThe head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work.\n\"I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,\" said Mr Mason.",

They could be fast-tracked to specialists in hospital.\nIt was the cancer cases where patients either had vague or more difficult to diagnose symptoms - or the small number of cancers found in patients who said they were ill but mostly needed a quick test or scan to rule something serious out.\n\"We looked at 30,000 cancer cases - and more than 25% of all cancer cases were from this group where we didn't think it was something but it suddenly showed as being something and so it's important to find those cases,\" said Prof Olesen.\nWhat were the changes?\nThe model of care introduced in Denmark has three routes.\nFirst -  for patients with \" alarm\" symptoms of specific cancers - there are fast-track diagnosis and treatment routes with strict time targets.\nIn addition to that, by law, any patient with a physical illness in Denmark must be investigated within 30 days of a GP referral.\nSecond, the Danish health service from 2007 set up diagnosis centres - at existing hospitals and clinics - where patients with symptoms which GPs cannot diagnose are given a range of tests and scans quickly to find out what is wrong with them, whether it is cancer or something else.\nGP Dr Hanne Heje, who works in Aarhus - a city slightly smaller than Cardiff - said the new system helps doctors who suspect something is wrong but not necessarily cancer.\nIt also stops the \"ping pong\" between GPs and different specialists.\n\"Now we know there's a department meeting the patient with open arms saying 'we welcome you', even though there's not a diagnosis written on their forehead,\" she said.\nThe third route deals with the group of patients with minor symptoms, which are very unlikely to be cancer but in rare cases could be.\nThese patients go to so-called \"yes-no\" centres which offer a simple test or scan so they can be seen quickly and any problems identified.\n\"This can be solved within hours in some cases but 1% will have a serious disease and this can be detected,\" said Prof Olesen.\n\"For these patients before - they might have had to wait four to six months, so for the small percentage where something is found, they'd start treatment six months behind the time schedule.\"\nThe results so far\nProf Olesen - a former GP himself - said the changes have not led to a \"flooding of the system\" by more GP referrals but better organisation of how patients are diagnosed within existing resources.\nImportantly, he says it has also led to better survival rates.\n\"We've got very optimistic results showing Norway, Sweden and Finland are becoming better year by year,\" he said. \"But very clearly in the data Denmark is becoming better, a faster pace than before and catching up and getting closer to where we should be.\"\nDenmark has a similar health system in how it is funded and organised to Wales.\nHe said there could be lessons shared between Wales and Denmark on how better organisation can help \"in catching up the elite in Europe\".\nDr Tom Crosby, medical director of the Wales Cancer Network, said he had been impressed with how the Danish health service had broken down the barriers between GPs and specialists to work better together.\nHe said: \"People are not just doing tests in isolation - they are working together to achieve a diagnosis.\"",

War, is based on facts that have already appeared in Russian and foreign media since Crimea was annexed in March 2014 and conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine.\nBut its authors say putting the facts together and describing the human and economic cost of the conflict makes a very compelling case for accusing President Vladimir Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own ends.\nRussia has consistently denied accusations that it has sent regular troops and armour to help rebels in eastern Ukraine, arguing that any Russians serving there are \"volunteers\".\nBut Mr Yashin, who presented the report, said Russian soldiers and equipment were decisive to securing all major victories claimed by the pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\"All the separatists' key successes were secured by Russian army units,\" he said.\n\"The soldiers directly admit they were directed on to Ukraine territory, admit that they were brought there to take part in a war operation. There is no doubt they did not end up there by accident.\"\nThe dossier presents evidence of volunteer soldiers who admit that it was Russian generals, not separatists, who directed the main battles in eastern Ukraine.\nA Russian army veteran, described as helping to enlist volunteers, says they are not doing it for nothing: salaries can reach $2,000-3,000 (\u00c2\u00a31,250-1,900) a month.\nRussian spending on the conflict is calculated at 53bn roubles (\u00c2\u00a3665m; $1bn):\nBoris Nemtsov began work on the report early this year, after hearing that the relatives of dead Russian soldiers had not been given promised compensation.\nBut those relatives never went public and, after his assassination, have become even more scared.\nNames and numbers of military units are documented, along with photos of weaponry, although activists point out these are harder to verify without knowing where they were taken.\nHow many Russians are fighting in Ukraine?\nBBC team attacked while investigating soldiers' deaths\nRussian families look for soldier sons\nMr Yashin said the opposition would seek donations to extend the initial print run of only 2,000 copies.\nBut publishing and distributing this kind of dossier is hard work. Many publishers were afraid to work with this material, he said.\nAnd above all, the question remains: How many people are keen to learn the facts which for months have been available on the internet and the few liberal media that remain in Russia?\nThere are plenty of Russians aware of their country's involvement in eastern Ukraine, who nevertheless find it acceptable, because they believe Moscow is supporting those who wish to be independent of the government in Kiev.\nBut the opposition does not see it as support. It accuses President Putin of masterminding and directing the war to boost his failing popularity.\nIn this, they admit he was successful.\nAnd it is entirely possible their report may well see the same fate as earlier works published by the late Boris Nemtsov.\nCritics of Mr Putin praised Mr Nemtsov's reports on corruption in the president's entourage and on the true cost of the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\nBut they failed to galvanise protests against him.",

This is unacceptable and is the culmination of a deeply frustrating process in which the devolved administrations have persistently been treated with a lack of respect.\n\"It is all the more regrettable given the UK government's stated aim was to develop a negotiating framework for the whole of the UK.\"\nMr Jones may have been playing to an audience, but Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns hit back: \"I'm a bit disappointed in that.

She told Donald Tusk: \"When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom, we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\"But it is the expectation of the government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration.\"\nThat sentence may have been written more with Scotland in mind, but it does prompt the question: which powers? Farming? Economic aid? And will the money follow the powers?\nAlun Cairns wouldn't answer those questions, although Carwyn Jones has said he fears there won't be any money to accompany the powers after 2020. (Perhaps Mr Jones doesn't think Jeremy Corbyn will win power that year - Labour has pledged to maintain EU funding levels on regional aid beyond 2020).\nSome in Whitehall think the way EU money has been spent in Wales - check out Nick Clegg's film from Ebbw Vale - is an argument for transferring those powers to Westminster, but that looks politically less likely now.\nWe may get some more details about the process in a white paper on the Great Repeal Bill on Thursday but, at the moment, the identity of the powers the UK government wants to see devolved is something of a mystery.",

I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence.

Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State.\nBut why aren't the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition?\nWell it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn of new credit from the eurozone and (well maybe) the IMF, in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country.\nSurely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year.\nPresumably the explanation is that Greece's near-death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA (\"there is no alternative\").\nWhat is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular, in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal (tax and spending) austerity.\nWorse, his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too: the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend.\nNot that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment, but if retailers and wholesalers can't get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad, Christmas will be cancelled (70% of shops' orders are placed in September and October, bankers tell me).\nThere is the vice, in both senses of the word. Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze, which will undoubtedly further impoverish Greek people.\nSo for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission, the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead.\nMany would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half.\nSo if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing, a path to genuine recovery, Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid triumphalism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens' capitulation.",

    "document": "The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community.\nDr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. \"Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,\" he was once quoted as saying.\nAnd he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts.\nBut his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process.\nAfter the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form.\nScientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science.\nBorn in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict.\nAs an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive.\nThis inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted.\n\"Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,\" he said.\nDuring his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes.\nBut the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough.\nThen came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally.\nHe switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates.\nHis success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work \"any monkey\" could do.\nThe criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research.\nAnd, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis.\nHis greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme.\nBoth efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.\nNevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.\nIn 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.\nBut he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.\nThe project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.\nThe synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.\n\"I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,\" he said of the synthetic microbes.\n\"If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.\"",

    "document": "In the late 1960s/early 1970s, the ice fields slipping down Mont Blanc and the surrounding mountains of the European range covered some 375 sq km.\nBy the late 2000s, this area had fallen to about 275 sq km.\nThe research has been presented at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting, the world's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists.\nIt mirrors some findings of retreat occurring in other sectors of the Alps which sit across the borders of several nations, but predominantly Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Germany, France, and Italy.\nThe new French Alps glaciers inventory was produced by Marie Gardent, from the University of Savoie, and colleagues.\nIt assessed the roughly 600 glaciers in broad areas incorporating the Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye and Grande Rousse Arves massifs, as well as the famous Mont Blanc Massif in the north.\nThe team drew upon map archives, past satellite imagery and aerial photographs.  Manual inspection was used to check the automatic delineation methods employed in the pictures was correct.\n\"We use manual delineation to verify the satellite data because there can be a problem with debris cover on a glacier,\" explained Ms Gardent.\n\"Automatic delineation from satellite data will sometimes say there is no glacier when in fact we know there is one there.  Also, deep shadows can hide the glacier margins.\"\nThe only existing glacial inventory from the French Alps was published four decades ago within the context of the World Glacier Inventory. It found the overall area of ice to be about 375 sq km.\nBy 1985-86, in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s/early 80s, glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km, the new survey shows.\nSince then, the withdrawal has accelerated, with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s.\nThis represents an average loss of some 26% over the last 40 years. The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps, however.  The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors.  In the Belledonne Massif, for example, glaciers have almost completely disappeared; and in the Ecrins Massif, glacial retreat is more than three times stronger than in the Mont Blanc Massif.\n\"The glacier retreat is less important in the northern Alps than in the southern Alps,\" Ms Gardent emphasised.\n\"We think this is because of the lower elevation of the mountains in the south, but also because of climatic conditions which are different.  There is more precipitation in the north and there is also more cloud.\"\nThe northern region includes the biggest French glacier of all - La Mer de Glace, which falls over a 1,000m in altitude down Mont Blanc itself.  Its area today is just over 30 sq km, a shade smaller than the 31.5 sq km in the late 1960s/early 1970s.\nEfforts to assess and monitor glacier health are going on across the Alpine region.\nAt this very meeting three years ago, Swiss researchers reported that glaciers on their part of the European range were also losing mass at an accelerating rate.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk",

    "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break.\nHamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time.\nLobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack.\nBefore the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't.\nThe wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline.\nThe floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin.\nMerab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nGeorgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell.\nThe breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw.\nThe fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality.\nGeorgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though.\nAli Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth.\nScotland head coach Vern Cotter: \"It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points.\n\"In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball.\n\"But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to.\n\"I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him.

    "document": "You might forgive Laura Trott and Jason Kenny for leaving Rio rather full of themselves. Five competitions between them, five golds won. As of Tuesday night, had the couple been a country they would have sat 13th on the medal table, above Jamaica, Kenya and Brazil.\nThat would be to misunderstand what makes them tick. This is a couple who got engaged while on the sofa watching an episode of EastEnders.\nYou might think too that it would get competitive around the breakfast table in the cottage they share just outside Knutsford in Cheshire. Kenny now has six Olympic golds from three Games, more than Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Bradley Wiggins. Trott has four, more than any other British woman, and from one fewer Olympics.\nThat would be to misjudge their relationship. Cycling superstars on their own, together they can be almost ordinary, almost invisible. After the gold rush, after their tearful embrace in the Rio velodrome with the world watching on, that may be about to change.\n\"The difference in their characters is what makes it work for them,\" says Trott's father Adrian.\n\"Until he gets to know you, Jason is a little bit shy. He's quiet and understated. Laura is bubbly, chatty, just as you see in her interviews.\n\"If they were both like Jason, God only knows how they'd talk about anything. And God forbid having two Lauras in a household!\"\nThe relationship between the two began in the build-up to London 2012, with Kenny about to come out of Chris Hoy's muscled shadow at his second Olympics and Trott about to experience her first.\n\"I remember seeing Laura at the velodrome years ago,\" says Kenny's mother Lorraine.\n\"I said to my husband, 'Flipping heck, you need to watch this young lady.' She was in the elimination race, only a tiny thing, and she kept sprinting over the top of everyone. She was amazing.\n\"The first time I knew something was happening between the two of them was when Jason phoned me up and said, 'I'm bringing Trotty home for a bacon butty.'\n\"I said to him, 'Is she your girlfriend?' 'No, she's just a friend.'\n\"She made herself at home straight away. Into the house, sat down, feet up on the sofa.\n\"We liked her from the off. She's a girly girl, so I can talk make-up and clothes to her. It's such a treat - having had two sons, I've had years of remote-control cars and standing out in the rain, and at last I can talk to someone about posh shoes.\"\nTrott and Kenny are not the first couple to both win Olympic golds.\nSome (Steffi Graf, ladies' singles 1988, Andre Agassi, men's singles 1996) have carried more global renown. Others have also won gold in the same sport at the same Games, most recently triathletes Jan Frodeno and Emma Snowsill at Beijing in 2008. But no-one at a summer Games has more. No-one else gets even close.\nNeither has the British duo finished. Trott is 24, Kenny 28. The next Olympics in Tokyo are in their sights.\n\"When I first met Laura, what stuck in my mind was how she was on what she wanted to achieve,\" says her agent Luke Lloyd Davies.\n\"She said to me, 'I want to be the most decorated British Olympian of all time'. I remember thinking, for a 21-year-old to have that determination is remarkable.\n\"She reminds me of [former England rugby union player] Jonny Wilkinson - that same dedication, the way nothing will faze her in competition. Off the bike she is a really sweet 20-something. She likes getting dressed up, she dreams of Mulberry bags and Prada shoes. But when her peers are out partying, she is burying herself in training.\"\nAnd there is nothing glamorous about the sessions each put in at the velodrome at Manchester's Sportcity each day. Lap after 250m lap, staring at the black line and scuffed boards, round and round, lactic in the legs, fire in the lungs.\n\"It hurts so badly,\" Trott once told me. \"It's like your legs are getting squeezed. You try to fight against it, but it's horrible, and they're just getting tighter and tighter. You're going slower and slower.\"\nNothing has come easy. Born six weeks premature with a collapsed lung, Trott spent the first weeks of her life in intensive care. As a child she suffered serious asthma; at the exact moment she first sat on a bike, aged four, her big sister Emma - who would go on to race professionally for the Dutch team Dolmans-Boels - was crashing and breaking her leg at the bottom of the same hill.\nAs a young girl she preferred trampolining to her bike, only to be forced to give it up after repeatedly passing out in mid-air. \"I kept getting dehydrated during sessions, because you had to go out of the room to get a drink, and I was like, 'Nah, I'll carry on bouncing'.\"\nThat's the heroic stuff. Not everything she does ends in such glorious success,\n\"Laura is the sort of person who can ruin a baked potato in a microwave,\" says Adrian.\n\"We've always cooked with gas at home, but when she first moved into the British Cycling academy flats in Manchester, they had electricity instead. She put a potato in the oven to bake and thought she'd turned the gas on - except she'd put the grill on instead. Pretty soon it was on fire. She smoked the whole flat out.\"\nSo it is that Kenny tends to be entrusted with kitchen duties.\n\"He is a very good cook,\" says Lorraine. \"He now does a brilliant Sunday roast, although he never used to cook when he lived at home. He says Laura is the bad influence, that she's the one who buys the chocolate.\n\"He gets his sporting genes from me. I used to run 100m and 200m. His dad Michael is very self-disciplined, and Jason has inherited that from him.\n\"Unlike me, he copes well under pressure. I have to force myself to watch him in big finals. I used to put my hands over my eyes, but then he lost a race when I was doing that so I've had to go back to actually looking.\n\"When they were younger, we took both our boys to different sports - they were lively lads, so we were trying to keep them out of mischief. We were just an ordinary family, and he was an ordinary boy doing ordinary things.\n\"He's not changed at all. He's just Jason. His elder brother Craig is the chatterbox, so maybe Jason thought he never needed to talk. But he has a fantastic sense of humour. It's so dry I think sometimes people don't get it.\"\nFind out how to get into cycling with our special guide.\nWhen they return to the UK, Trott and Kenny will wind down by walking their two dogs, springer-poodle crosses named Pringle and Sprolo. In September they will get married. Already they have turned down an offer to have it featured in a magazine.\nFame has never been the driving force. Kenny may have 54,000 followers on Twitter, but he last tweeted in early July. Trott may have won more Olympic gold medals than any other British woman, but the motivation remains pure.\n\"It isn't a job to me, but if it did feel like one, it would be a dream job,\" she says. \"All I do is ride my bike for four hours a day and then lie on the sofa for the rest of it. I don't feel like I'd ever fall out of love with it.\"\nAnd each understands exactly what the other is going through. How could they not, when together they have turned a cottage in Cheshire into a medal factory?\n\"If I was in a relationship with someone outside cycling,\" says Trott, \"just imagine how hard it would be. I'd have to explain everything from scratch.\"\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",

There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.\nHe said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.\n\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\n\"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\"\nThe commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.\nA Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".\nHe added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.\n\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\"",

Nor did he accept that the fall of Aleppo was also due to a failure of US diplomatic strategy. \"You can't make someone do something through diplomacy that they're not prepared to negotiate,\" he told me.\nCritics in Washington, though, have slammed the Obama administration for refusing to back that diplomacy with the threat of credible force, giving Mr Kerry very little to work with other than good faith.\nSome have faulted the secretary of state for having too much faith in Russia's willingness for a deal - \"delusional diplomacy\", the Washington Post called it.\nMr Kerry made clear he would continue his tireless efforts to reach a peace deal. But the fall of Aleppo almost certainly means he has run out of time to do so in the waning weeks of this administration, and the Syria crisis will be passed on to the next one.\nSyrian state media said rebels had blown up their ammunition dumps and destroyed documents before leaving the city.\nA statement from the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Opposing Sides in Syria, part of Russia's ministry of defence, said the Syrian authorities had guaranteed the safety of all members of the armed groups who decided to leave Aleppo.\nThe rebels confirmed a fresh ceasefire had come into effect at 03:00 GMT and that a new deal had been agreed.\nAs operations began, an ambulance service official in eastern Aleppo said that one convoy of ambulances had been shot at, with three people injured.\nThe White Helmets civil defence group tweeted that one senior volunteer had been shot and injured by a sniper while clearing an evacuation route for ambulances.\nBuses and ambulances are taking the injured, civilians and rebel fighters to the neighbouring province of Idlib, most of which is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes the jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.\nThe buses left Aleppo via the road through the government-controlled south-western district of Ramousseh, heading towards the nearby rebel-held towns of Khan Touman and Khan al-Asal.\nThe chief of the Russian military's General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, told a news briefing: \"A humanitarian corridor has been created for the evacuation of militants.\"\n\"This corridor is 21km long,\" he said, adding, \"6km lie across Aleppo's territories controlled by government troops and another 15km through territories in the hands of illegal armed groups.\"\nTurkey, which helped to broker the evacuation, is preparing to receive some of the most vulnerable civilians, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.\nIn a televised address, he said Turkey would take \"children, elders, those who are really in difficult conditions\".\nThe head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Kinik, told reporters that the wounded would be the first to be transferred.\nUN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said about 50,000 people were still trapped and he warned that moving those evacuated to Idlib might not prove much safer.\n\"If there is no political agreement and a ceasefire, Idlib will become the next Aleppo,\" he told reporters in Paris.\nThe 50,000 are said to include about 4,000 fighters and about 10,000 of their family members.\nAleppo's besieged residents have faced weeks of bombardment and chronic food and fuel shortages.\nRussian Lt Gen Viktor Poznikhir said on Thursday that, with the evacuation, the Syrian armed forces had almost finished their operations in Aleppo. Fighting has raged there for four years.\nIn October, President Assad said victory in Aleppo would be \"the springboard... to liberate other areas from terrorists\", a term the government uses to describe all rebel fighters.\nHe singled out Idlib province, west of Aleppo, that is almost entirely controlled by an alliance of Islamist rebel factions and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front.\nIdlib contains border crossings used by rebels to receive supplies from Turkey, a key backer. It also borders the coastal province of Latakia, the heartland of Mr Assad's minority Alawite sect.",

    "document": "Younger people take religion seriously \"when they have the chance to learn about it,\" he said.\nAnd Cardinal Keith O'Brien, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, urged Christians to wear a cross to symbolise their beliefs.\nIt comes amid a growing debate about secularisation in British society.\nMeanwhile, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh have attended traditional Easter Sunday service at Windsor Castle.\nDuring the service at Canterbury Cathedral, Dr Williams said it was the wrong time to \"downgrade the status and professional excellence\" of religious education in schools.\nRE is not one of the subjects counting towards the English Baccalaureate, the standard for ranking schools brought in by the coalition government.\nThe English Baccalaureate ranks secondary schools in England according to the number of pupils who get good GCSEs in English, maths, science, another language and a humanities subject - either geography or history.\nSupporters of religious education want to see it included in the humanities category.\nBy Robert PigottReligious affairs correspondent, BBC News\nDuring his decade as leader of the Church of England, Dr Williams has repeatedly complained that Christianity is being marginalised in British public life.\nToday he welcomed what he said was a reduction in active hostility towards religion, but issued a new warning.\nIt was that \"serious and liberal-minded commentators\" were embracing religion as a socially useful tool - for example for rethinking our \"destructive economic habits\" - but wanted to \"pick out the best bits of religion without all the embarrassing beliefs that go with it\".\nThe archbishop insisted that it was precisely those awkward beliefs - such as the actual resurrection of Jesus - that mattered in Christianity, and that without them it would cease to make sense.\nHis fear is that Christianity might survive the active hostility of atheists, only to succumb to a kind of asset stripping which reduced it to a set of well-meaning principles without really saying anything about God.\nBut the government says it is already a compulsory National Curriculum subject and the English Baccalaureate is to encourage more students to take up geography and history in addition to RE - not instead of it.\nIn his sermon, Dr Williams said: \"There is plenty to suggest that younger people, while still statistically deeply unlikely to be churchgoers, don't have the hostility to faith that one might expect, but at least share some... sense that there is something here to take seriously - when they have a chance to learn about it.\n\"It is about the worst possible moment to downgrade the status and professional excellence of religious education in secondary schools.\"\nDr Williams said a hostility towards faith and religion in public life may have been tempered by a recent appreciation of the social value of religion.\nBut he said the ultimate test of Christianity was not whether it was beneficial to the human race, but whether the resurrection of Jesus Christ actually happened.\nHe said that for Christians a vision of reconciled love between people \"is there only because God raised Jesus\" and that the answer was not in scientific proof, but by the way believers lived with and in their faith.\nThe latest debate on faith in Britain was ignited after Conservative co-chairwoman Baroness Warsi warned that the nation was under threat from a rising tide of \"militant secularisation\".\nThe Muslim peer said in February that Europe needed to become \"more confident and more comfortable in its Christianity\".\nResearch carried out in the same month by a secularist foundation suggested three-quarters of people who describe themselves as Christian in Britain displayed only a low level of belief and practice of the religion.\nThe Ipsos Mori poll, for the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, was rubbished by the Church, with Reverend Giles Fraser, former Canon Chancellor of St Paul's, saying it was not fair to trump people's \"self-identification\" as Christians.\nIn his Easter Sunday sermon, Cardinal O'Brien told worshippers to \"wear proudly a symbol of the cross of Christ\" each day of their lives.\nHe also voiced concern at the growing \"marginalisation\" of religion.\nDr Williams also issued a call for peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Middle East.\nHe said: \"A visit to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem, will convince you why the state of Israel exists and must go on existing.\n\"A visit to any border checkpoint will convince you that the daily harassment and humiliation of Palestinians of all ages and backgrounds cannot be a justifiable or even sustainable price to pay for security.\"\nHe said: \"We have to prod and nag and encourage the religious leadership in the Holy Land on all sides to speak as if they believed in a God who acts, not only a God who endorses their version of reality.\n\"We have to pray, to pray for wisdom and strength and endurance for all who are hungry for peace and justice, pray that people will go on looking for a truly shared future.\"\nIn March, Dr Williams announced he would step down as Archbishop of Canterbury - the head of the Church of England - in December, after 10 years in the role.",

If we bat two days the result will go our way. There's no reason why we can't dig deep.\n\"We've got to learn from our first innings with the bat - be more patient. There were too many 30s in the first innings, so we need to try and push on a bit more and have a couple of our top five get big hundreds.\"\nEngland batsman Ian Bell: \"There are no gimmes and we expect more tomorrow.

The child was there, the child needed radiotherapy.\n\"The use of protons does not improve cure rates of tumours... and it saddens me to see the way the truth can be twisted and misunderstood.\"\nIn Prague, Ashya's parents refused the chemotherapy, which had been recommended by doctors and ordered by the High Court.\nBut in March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Mr King said his son was cancer free.\nPaediatric oncology consultant Dr Ramya Ramanujachar, who was involved in Ashya's treatment, warned the case could set a worrying precedent.\nShe said: \"I don't think the parents can look after their own child with a brain tumour and be not only the carers but also the professionals directing, managing and dictating their child's treatment.\"\nDr Wilson said the case had led to an \"impossible situation\" for clinicians faced with families in the same situation.\n\"That is deeply unfair when the NHS is always supposed to be about equal healthcare for all,\" he added.\nAshya: The Untold Story is to be broadcast on BBC1 in the South region on Friday at 19:30 BST.",

There, people make comments they would not dare speak out loud in public.\nAngolans living in the diaspora have also been busy online, creating websites to rally support for regime change, and there have been several solidarity protest events held in South Africa, the UK and Belgium.\nMany are growing weary of the current regime and want more to be done to share the country's oil wealth among the majority, two thirds of whom still live in poverty and many without access to water or electricity.\nThe introduction of a special internet law was seen as a deliberate attempt to quash the online discussion that was fuelling this unrest.\nIn an uncharacteristically emotional speech last month, President dos Santos lashed out at social media sites, saying they were being used to \"insult, denigrate and provoke uproar and confusion\".\nOfficially the government stuck to its position that the technology legislation was needed to curb crimes such as child pornography, hacking and online financial fraud.\nThe editor of the private weekly newspaper Angolense, Suzana Mendes, who was among the journalists who publicly voiced concerns about the law, welcomed its withdrawal.\n\"The fact that the bill has been cancelled is important, because if it had been approved, it would have endangered our fundamental rights to inform and be informed,\" she told the BBC.\nSizaltina Cutaia, from the Angolan office of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (Osisa), which also opposed the bill, said they were pleased the government had backed down.\n\"This is definitely a victory for us and it is encouraging that we were able to get our message across.\" she said.\nHowever, civil society celebrations around the scrapping of the legislation were short-lived after a number of activists were arrested on Wednesday for taking part in an anti-poverty demonstration in Luanda.\nOrganised via Facebook by a group calling itself the Revolutionary Movement of Social Intervention (MRIS), the protest was due to take place at lunchtime.\nBut following the arrest of MRIS leader Luis Bernardo, allegedly detained while putting up posters near his home in the district of Cazenga, only a few dozen people gathered in the city square.\nAccording to reports, between 15 and 20 people were detained, among them a journalist and a representative from Osisa who had been trying to film the arrests.\nThey were later released and rejoined the protest, which at its height numbered around 100 people.\nA spokesman for Luanda's provincial government told state media that the youth involved, who claimed they had authorisation to stage the protest, had acted \"criminally\" and the police force was within its rights to respond.\n\"What the government needs to realise is that the more they repress people, the more they will want to demonstrate,\" Ms Cutaia said.\nAlthough small in size and number, protests like these are a relatively new phenomenon in Angola where few have dared to question the authority of President Dos Santos and his ruling MPLA.\n\"The people leading these protests are young and they don't have as much to lose. They were born after independence so they don't have that connection to the ruling party like older generations,\" Ms Cutaia says.\n\"All they see is that despite Angola's wealth under the MPLA most people have remained poor and they want that to change.\n\"Most of all they want the right to be able to make their voices heard.\"",

It gave no other details.\nChinese shares fell by nearly 8% after a week of volatile trading that spread fear to global markets.\nThe Tianjin explosions killed 150 people - with 23 still missing.\nA total of 367 people remain in hospital after the 12 August blast at a warehouse where large amounts of toxic chemicals were stored. Twenty are in critical condition, according to Xinhua.\nSeparately, the UK's Financial Times says Chinese leaders feel they mishandled their stock market rescue efforts.\nThe paper, quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday, said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of \"destabilising the market\".\nChinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours.\nThe rumours described by the latest statement include reports that a man had jumped to his death in Beijing due to the stock market slump and that as many as 1,300 people were killed in Tianjin blasts, Xinhua said.\nThe news agency said \"seditious rumours about China's upcoming commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II\" were also among the offences.\nA journalist was also arrested along with several stock market officials, according to a Xinhua report. The journalist, Wang Xiaolu, is accused of \"spreading fake information\" about the market slump, the report said.\nThe state news agency said Mr Wang confessed that he \"wrote fake report on Chinese stock market based on hearsay and his own subjective guesses without conducting due verifications\".\nIn 2013 Chinese authorities introduced a possible three-year sentence for spreading rumours - the sentence was supposed to apply to anyone who posted a rumour that was reposted 500 times or viewed 5,000 times.\nLast year, Qin Zhihui, a blogger, was sentenced to three years in a government crackdown on internet rumours. Mr Qin was found guilty of \"slander\" and \"picking quarrels and provoking troubles\", state broadcaster CCTV said at the time.",

    "document": "On Thursday, an investment manager and hairdresser will challenge the right of the government to start the process of withdrawing the UK from the EU without a vote in Parliament.\nLawyers will question whether Prime Minister Theresa May is entitled to act unilaterally, using powers left over from the days of medieval monarchs.\nIt could end up - in theory - with Parliament being given a means to stop Brexit.\nSo as constitutional rows go, it is box office stuff.\nOr as professor of public law at Cambridge University, Mark Elliott, puts it: \"I don't rule out the possibility of the government losing the case.\"\nLeading the fight against the government is Gina Miller, who runs an investment firm in London, SCM Private.\nShe argues that only Parliament can make a decision that leads to the loss of her \"rights\" under EU law.\nShe is confident she has a strong case and is undaunted by criticism.\n\"I do not back away from a fight,\" she says. \"I'm very vocal about things and I'm no stranger to making enemies.\"\nShe is joined by London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney and backed by a crowd-funding campaign.\nAlso weighing into the case against the government is the group, Fair Deal for Expats.\nAround two million British citizens are believed to live and work in other EU countries.\nThe Brexit terms have not been decided but expats - some of whom were barred from voting in the referendum - fear potential repatriation and are worried about the impact on their jobs and homes as well as the ramifications for healthcare, their children's schooling and pensions.\nThree London law firms - Mishcon de Reya, Edwin Coe and Bindmans - have agreed to take up the case. Croft Solicitors is representing the expats.\nSuperstar of the bar\" Lord Pannick QC - also an independent member of the House of Lords - will be arguing Gina Miller's case while the government is turning to an old favourite, James Eadie QC.\nAttorney General Jeremy Wright QC, the government's legal adviser, will also play a big role.\nHe said: \"There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to re-join it through the back door, and no second referendum.\n\"We do not believe this case has legal merit. The result should be respected and the government intends to do just that.\"\nIn political terms, the UK is on course for departure from the EU. But as far as the law goes, nothing has changed.\nThe UK remains a fully paid-up member of the EU until it triggers Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon 2007.\nThe question at the heart of the row is: who should activate Article 50? The prime minister or Parliament?\nDuring the referendum campaign, the then prime minister, David Cameron, said that in the event of a Leave vote he would activate Article 50 immediately. The government maintains that his successor Theresa May has the authority to do so, without a vote by MPs.\nThat right - they say - is based on the Royal Prerogative - powers once held by kings and queens to do, essentially, what they wished.\nThe use of prerogative powers in a modern parliamentary democracy is a curious corner of British law.\nOver centuries, power in the UK has been wrested away from dictatorial monarchs and handed to elected politicians.\nBut government ministers have managed to cling on to a few of those regal powers, usually in international affairs.\nOne such prerogative is the power to make and break treaties with other countries.\nThe government's position is that triggering Article 50 is all about ending a treaty with other EU countries and so using prerogative powers in these circumstances is \"entirely consistent with standard constitutional practice\".\nCritics will argue in the High Court that it is a bit more complicated than that.\nThey say that activating Article 50 effectively wipes out the European Communities Act 1972, passed by Parliament and allowing EU law to apply in the UK.\nLawyers opposing the government argue that the 1972 Act introduced a big constitutional change and gave British people new rights.\nIt would be unlawful, they conclude, for a prime minister to use the Royal Prerogative to take away rights bestowed by Parliament.\nGrahame Pigney, from the People's Challenge, says the \"enforced removal\" of citizenship rights from 65 million people would be \"completely unprecedented\" in a modern democracy.\n\"I believe that, as Parliament has granted us these rights, it is for Parliament to decide when, how and under what circumstances they are taken away,\" he says.\nLawyers working for Fair Deal for Expats will be deploying similar legal arguments but using evidence to emphasise the human impact of Brexit.\nThe chairman of Fair Deal for Expats, John Shaw - who lives in France - has submitted a statement to the High Court saying the referendum result was a \"shock\".\nHe is currently undergoing cancer treatment in France.\nHe states: \"If my right to access healthcare is either taken away, or compromised materially such that I am not able to rely upon it in the same way as French nationals, I would be unlikely to receive, or be able to afford, the same level of care in France.\"\nHis lawyers will tell the High Court that the rights enjoyed by British citizens \"beyond these shores\" are so fundamental that legislation is \"required\" to take them away.\nBut in legal papers setting out the government's case - released last week - it insists that starting the withdrawal process will not have any impact on British laws and any changes will be decided in future negotiations.\nThe Royal Prerogative is just one of the arguments to be aired in the High Court.\nThere will be heated debates about the 2015 European Union Referendum Act, which paved the way for a referendum.\nIn their legal papers the government states that Parliament passed that Act on the \"clear understanding\" that the outcome of the referendum would be \"respected\".\nIf Gina Miller wins the case - it adds - it will not be able to \"give effect to the will and decision of the people\".\nConservative chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, and prominent Leave campaigner Sir Bill Cash thinks the government has a strong case, saying: \"To attempt to revisit the decision by another Act of Parliament is a kind of fraud on the electorate.\"\nBut lawyers at Mishcon de Reya say the idea was to set up an \"advisory\" referendum - not a binding one.\nThey state: \"Nowhere in the 2015 Act does it specify the consequences that should follow from the referendum result.\"\nThe biggest weapon in the government's armoury could be that the whole issue is not a matter for the UK courts at all.\nThey says it is a complex decision that must be made by ministers.\nSir Bill Cash said: \"We could have a situation where judges are imposing a requirement on Parliament, via the secretary of state, to make legislation.\n\"That's outside the rules. The proceedings of parliament are outside the jurisdiction of the court.\"\nLord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, will hear the case - which is expected to last a couple of weeks.\nMark Elliott says it is very hard to know which way it will go.\n\"If the court simply applied existing case law, the government would win. The question is whether the court will go beyond existing territory and treat it as an exceptional situation. The court may develop the law.\"\nPutting the legal arguments aside, some Brexit supporters say that the High Court case is a fig-leaf for a political campaign to keep the UK inside the EU.\nGina Miller disputes that and argues that Leavers and Remainers should back her case against \"prerogative creep\".\n\"The idea that a court case can put a halt to Brexit is nonsense and it has nothing to do with altering the timetable. What we are looking for is legal certainty.\"\nIf the court concludes that Parliament must approve Article 50, that could be a game-changer.\nThe majority of MPs campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU. They could, in theory, vote against the activation of Article 50.\nBut would they risk enormous political and social ructions by rejecting the referendum result?\nMost members of the House of Lords are also opposed to Brexit. That raises the possibility of another extraordinary scenario - an unelected Lords voting against the wishes of 17.4 million people.\nIf the government loses its case in the British courts, they could eventually go to the European Court of Justice.\nIt raises the possibility of a truly strange scenario - Brexit ministers asking European judges to overturn the decision of the British courts.",

The football lads were fitter, yes, but more than that, they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march.\"\nE715 was located close to Auschwitz III, Monowitz, which held mainly Polish resistance fighters, political dissidents, homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops.\nWhilst this was not officially a death camp, Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Monowitz were far from safe.\n\"In the nights you could hear shots coming from Monowitz,\" he said.\n\"Not bursts like you had when you were fighting, but deliberate, regular every few seconds; like they had a system going.\n\"We didn't know who they were or why they'd been killed, and we couldn't help but be terrified that we'd be next.\"\nBut when the British PoWs were allowed out to play football, they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II, Birkenau, where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale.\n\"The first Sunday we went to the playing fields, we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches,\" he said.\n\"We asked, 'Who are those poor sods?' and the German guards shout 'Juden', Jews, as if it had been a stupid question.\n\"We could only play in the summer, because everything was covered in snow through the winter. But when it was hot, this awful stench would waft across from the crematoriums.\n\"Your imaginations pretty much filled in the gaps for you, but we'd carry on playing football.\n\"Scoring a goal, making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up.\"\nMr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birkenau.\n\"You have to remember that our guards weren't SS like in Birkenau; they were conscripted squaddies like us,\" he said.\n\"Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us, and if you got them on their own, you could tell that they were ordinary, decent blokes.\n\"But if you asked them about Birkenau they'd get angry and scared. 'We didn't need to know', 'they didn't know', 'it was nothing', and even if it was, then 'it wasn't their fault, they weren't SS'.\"\n\"I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war, but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through.\n\"Some would say they deserve it, but most likely they couldn't have done any more about it than we could have ourselves.\"\nAs the Red Army closed in, on 21 January, 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones's hut in the middle of the night, and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry.\nThe Soviets liberated Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945, confirming for the first time the stories of the Holocaust's mass murder, which the Allies had hitherto rubbished as too extreme to be possible.\nBut by the time the Russians arrived, Mr Jones was long gone; as part of the death march west, which killed anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 Allied PoWs.\n\"We were on the road for 17 weeks, and God knows how many hundreds of miles we traipsed, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria.\"\n\"I was 13 stone (82kg) when I was captured, and when I was liberated by the Americans in April 1945, they weighed me, and I was seven stone.\"\nMr Jones considers himself one of the lucky ones.\n\"I was very lucky. I came home to a good wife, who helped me get over it. But lots never really recovered at all,\" he said.\n\"I think I'm probably the last now. There was another of the footballers who I got Christmas cards from, but there was nothing this year. So at 94, I think it's probably time to tell the story before it's too late.\"",

But \"honest people will not face any problem\", he added.\nAfter Mr Modi's surprise announcement on Tuesday night, the banks were closed on Wednesday.\nThousands of panicked Indians have been flocking to banks since they reopened on Thursday.\nThere are limits on cash withdrawals from ATMs and banks.\nThe 500 ($7; \u00c2\u00a36) and 1,000 ($15; \u00c2\u00a312) rupee notes are the highest denomination notes in the country and are extremely common in India. Airports, railway stations, hospitals and fuel stations will only accept them until the end of today.\nPeople will be able to exchange their money at banks between 10 November and 30 December.\nThe actual figure is unclear but correspondents say the issue of \"black money\" - which may have been acquired corruptly, or is being withheld from the tax authorities - is a huge problem. India's government hopes to flush out tax evaders and make money that is unaccounted for visible for tax purposes. There have been reports of tax raids in many parts of India.\nAn individual can put as much as he or she likes into the bank - but withdrawals are limited so the banking system may end up being flooded with cash.\nGovernment guidelines say it is possible to exchange up to 4,000 rupees per day up to 24 November - anything over this will be subject to tax laws. People can also withdraw up to 10,000 rupees from a bank per day and a maximum of 20,000 rupees per week.\nNew 2,000 and 500 rupee denomination notes with new security features are being given to people to replace those removed from circulation.\nA new 1,000 rupee note \"with a new dimension and design\" will also be introduced in due course, a senior government official said on Thursday.\nThey can purchase foreign exchange equivalent to 5,000 rupees using these bank notes at airport exchange counters until midnight on Friday.",

I just want to have it free-flowing,\" he told BBC Sport.\nSince his move to Sale was announced in March, Charnley has been to the AJ Bell Stadium to watch the team as much as possible.\nWith his focus on league as a youngster, he did not grow up watching the Premiership, Six Nations or England internationals.\n\"I've wanted to try union for a while,\" he added.\n\"I've been lucky enough to be successful in league and achieve things that not many people can achieve so when the opportunity came to switch codes, I couldn't turn it down.\n\"I've been watching a lot of games and analysing it.

He added a penalty in injury-time which was awarded after Sam Clucas was sent off for handball from Lucas Perez's header.\nIn between, Hector Bellerin and Sanchez both failed to hit the target and Mesut Ozil volleyed over the crossbar for Arsenal.\nStriker Oumar Niasse had Hull's best chances - his header and low strike forced Petr Cech into sharp saves - while Adama Diomande nodded over late on.\nArsenal had been pressing for the opener before Sanchez's intervention.\nThe visitors failed to clear Kieran Gibbs' low shot and as the ball ricocheted off goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic on the ground it bounced off the Chilean's hand and into the net.\nFor a deliberate handball, Football Association laws state:\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOn this occasion, Sanchez did not look like he purposefully pushed the ball into the net and he had little time to move out of the way after the ball came off Jakupovic.\nAfter consultation with his assistant, referee Mark Clattenburg awarded the goal, but prior to that in the first half, Theo Walcott had a shot blocked by the hand of Clucas inside the area, for which no penalty was given.\nAfter the game, Hull defender Andrew Robertson told Sky Sports that Clattenburg had apologised to the Hull players after half-time.\nRobertson added: \"The ref told us he didn't give it because he wasn't 100% sure. Not many referees can admit they're wrong, so it's good when he does, though it doesn't make things better.\"\nNews app users should click this link to vote\nChasing the game in the second half, Hull's Lazar Markovic was running onto a long punt forward deep in the Arsenal half.\nThe Serb was barged down by Gibbs, who was the last defender, and had the on-loan Liverpool man not been infringed, he would have had a clear run through on goal from 30 yards.\nClattenburg spotted the incident and presented a yellow card.\nGibbs said after the game: \"I took a chance with the challenge on Markovic.

    "document": "This is the full statement to the inquests from his niece, Ms Natalie Tennant, on behalf of his brother, Peter Copoc:\nStephen Paul Copoc was born on 1 August 1968, and was aged 20 years when he died at Hillsborough.\nStephen was the baby of our family, and the apple of our Mum's eye. Our family consisted of Mum and Dad, I, Peter, my sister Angela and then our Stephen. I was 10 years old when Stephen was born. Angela was just seven years old.\nOur Dad took us to the hospital, so that we could meet our new baby brother. Mum and Dad said that Angela and I could name him, and we did. Financially, we had little, but our parents, Agnes and Harold, made sure that there was lots of love in our house.\nStephen was such a joy to all of us. Mum and Dad only received good reports from Stephen's school regarding his conduct and application to his lessons.\nProfiles of all those who died\nStephen's personality was such that people warmed to him instantly as he had an easy way with him. He was popular with teachers and made friends, having the ability to also keep friends. The friends that he made when he was small were still his close friends when he died on that awful day.\nWhen we moved from Garston to our new house in Speke, Stephen had no problems adapting to the new environment, getting to know our new neighbours and making friends in an effortless and  uncomplicated way.\nI started work at 17. There was a shop in Garston called Smiths that sold everything. It's gone now. I bought Stephen a train set when I got paid. He was about nine at the time and wanted one.\nAs Angela and I were so much older than him, we kind of spoilt him, as he was such a lovable kid. I remember us both setting up the train set together and the joy Stephen got playing with it.\nHe was so careful about his toys. When he finished playing with the train set, he would put it away neatly. He minded his toys.\nHe used to follow Angela everywhere, even if she was going out to meet friends he would follow her and she would complain to Mum and Dad about having to bring 11 him.\nHowever, one day someone told Angela that there was an accident on the road and that Stephen was hurt. Angela ran down the cinder path near our home towards the school crying.\nWhen she got there, she was told he had not waited for the lollipop lady and got a bump from a car. He was physically fine, but Angela was sobbing and so distressed at the thought that Stephen was hurt.\nAngela was so good to Stephen and minded him throughout his childhood. All her friends knew him well because he was like her shadow.\nStephen started to take an interest in birds when he was about 12 years old. He started to study them and could tell you the name of most birds as well as their  eggs. It was also around this time that he became interested in fishing.\nWe had cousins that were avid fishermen and they took him along to Speke Hall, which is a rural setting in a National Trust estate right in the middle of Liverpool. He just loved fishing there and knew all about the fish that lived in the waters there.\nHe seldom, if ever, brought fish home to Mum and Dad. It was a joke in our house about Stephen catching fish, but he preferred to put the fish back into the water.\nWe think it was the birds and the fishing that started Stephen wanted to work out of doors. He appreciated being outdoors.\nHe finished school at 16 years of age and studied for his City and Guilds in Botany and Horticulture. He could name any flower and plant and was perfectly at home with nature.\nHe applied for and got a job with the Liverpool Parks and Gardens based in Calderstones Park. He treasured his job and became a gardener at Sudley Hall in Mossley Hill.\nHe loved his work, the people he worked with, he enjoyed meeting all the visitors and telling them about the gardens.\nWhen Stephen was about 15 years old, he met his girlfriend Jackie. They were very much in love and were engaged to be married when he died.\nStephen knew what he wanted from life. He was very close to our Mum and his main ambition in life was to save enough money to buy our parents a house. He did not want them living in rented accommodation.\nHe was mature and sensible for his age. He took out insurance policies in case anything happened to him, as he wanted our parents to have some money.\nHe was very caring to his nieces and nephews. When Angela's marriage broke down and she was on her own with her two children, Sean and Carla, Stephen with his  girlfriend Jackie would babysit and play with the children, keeping them amused for hours.\nHe could have been out with his mates but knew that Angela needed time alone and his family always came first with him.\nStephen, of course, loved football. His love of football and of Liverpool came from our Dad. The whole family travelled around to watch the matches, but not since 1989.\nAfter 1989, we gave the season tickets back and we never went to a football match again.\nStephen loved to play football as well. He was not the best of players, but he was like an encyclopaedia when it came to anything about football generally.\nStephen was a great music fan. He was always playing Pink Floyd and, in particular, 'Shine on you Crazy Diamond'. He always loved Marillion and went to concerts with his four close friends.\nOur parents never got over Stephen's death and the way he died. Our brother Stephen was one of life's genuine nice guys.\nOur Stephen was just 20 years of age, but had maturity and a caring attitude towards others and even from a young age carried a donor card.\nWe miss Stephen from our family and think about what might have been for all of us as a family if Stephen had not died on that awful day. Thank you.",

    "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe Sweden striker, who is out of contract after four years at Paris St-Germain, could follow former manager Jose Mourinho to Old Trafford.\nFootball finance expert Rob Wilson says the 34-year-old would be United's most marketable player since Cristiano Ronaldo, and linking up with the three-time European champions would be a \"match made in heaven\".\nWilson says Ibrahimovic's shirt sales alone would help cover the cost of finishing fifth in the Premier League this season and missing out on the riches of playing in Europe's elite competition, worth up to \u00a350m.\n\"It would not surprise me if Zlatan sold more shirts than Ronaldo or Lionel Messi,\" Wilson, a lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University, told BBC Sport.\n\"The cost of missing out on the Champions League is \u00a330-50m. Zlatan will help plug that gap significantly with the number of shirts shifted by United.\n\"It is a match made in heaven. The football club is commercially so aware who will exploit every commercial opportunity.\n\"To them, they are signing a player who understands commercial endorsements and behaves in a way that allows him to maximise them.\n\"Put that together and you get the holy grail stakes of shirt sales, and stacks of corporate sponsorship.\n\"Zlatan is also the sort of player who brings ad hoc ticket buyers to a match, even if it is the Europa League or League Cup.\n\"It is matching the world's biggest sporting brands with one of the most marketable players, who has cult following, plus it is his career swansong.\n\"If you marry that with Manchester United, he will probably shift more shirts in the next year than any player in the squad because of the superstar status that he has.\"\nWilson claimed that Ibrahimovic could become the face of Manchester United.\n\"Zlatan has a global profile, and global appeal,\" he said. \"Fans will buy shirts with Ibrahimovic on the back in Africa, South East Asia - markets United had a foothold in but not the leverage.\n\"Only a few select few players can do that: Gareth Bale, Neymar, Lionel Messi and Ronaldo.\"\nIf they are the off-pitch benefits of signing Ibrahimovic, what else will the enigmatic Swede bring to Old Trafford and the Premier League?\nSince making his debut for his hometown club of Malmo in 1999, Ibrahimovic has played for some of Europe's biggest clubs: Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan and PSG, commanding transfer fees of more than \u00a3120m.\nHe has scored 392 goals in 677 games and last season was his most prolific, with 50 goals in 51 matches - a record for PSG - while his 38 league goals is also a club record.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIbrahimovic does not do ordinary goals. He scored four against England in a friendly in 2012, including an amazing overhead kick and then there are the free-kicks, long-range goals, back-heels, flicks and scorpion goals.\nManchester United's FA Cup victory on Saturday was their first trophy since the Premier League title in 2013, when Sir Alex Ferguson retired.\nBut Ibrahimovic is used to regular success and has won 12 trophies in four seasons at PSG, including the domestic quadruple twice.\nWhile he may not have the same Ballon d'Or collection as Messi or Ronaldo, at least Ibrahimovic can console himself with being - beyond doubt - the best player in Sweden.\nThe striker has won a record 10 Guldbollen (Golden Ball), the award given to the best male footballer in his home country.\nIbrahimovic is one of the most quotable figures in world football. Here are just a few examples:\nJohanna Franden, international football correspondent for Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, has spent four years in Paris reporting on Ibrahimovic.\n\"He will play up to that image that people had of him,\" Franden told BBC Sport.\n\"When he says these things there is still a smile behind it, but for the last 15 years he has had so many people telling him how good he is that I think he does believe all of it.\"\nIbrahimovic has always enjoyed a spiky relationship with the media and his critics.\nIn 2015, after the semi-final of the French League Cup, he ordered his team-mates not to talk to journalists. When questioned why, he said: \"Because I am the boss.\"\n\"Only God knows\" was Ibrahimovic's answer when quizzed by a journalist about Sweden's chances against Portugal in the 2014 World Cup play-offs.\n\"Well, it's a bit hard to ask him\", the reporter said, to which the player replied: \"You're talking to him now.\"\nOn another occasion, he was forced to apologise for describing France in not so endearing terms.\n\"There will be a clash [with the media],\" said Franden. \"He will not hold back. He is not scared by the media; he will tell the journalists what he thinks.\n\"You expect if there is any discontent it will leak out.\n\"He can handle the pressure, but he keeps his private life private, he does not invite the press in and his partner Helena Seger will be in the limelight more than she has been so far.\"\nIbrahimovic could soon be linking up with England captain Wayne Rooney.\nIn a BBC documentary, he said of Rooney: \"I'd prefer to have him in my team than play against him. I've not been lucky enough to play with him but I enjoy seeing him on the pitch. If I cannot play with him, I will watch him.\"\nBut it is fair to say Ibrahimovic has not always enjoyed the best relationship with team-mates and it is safer to stay on his good side.\nHe once put AC Milan team-mate Gennaro Gattuso in a bin after a training session, in retaliation for being teased by the Italian.\nA fight with AC Milan team-mate and 6ft 5in American Oguchi Onyewu ended with a broken rib for Ibrahimovic, he once threatened to break Ajax team-mate Rafael van der Vaart's legs and another time he hit Mido after the Egyptian threw a pair of scissors at him.\nEarlier this year, Ibrahimovic told his PSG team-mates at half-time to \"play as I tell you and everything will be fine\".\n\"It is a good time for him to go to United, as there is not such a clear leader in the squad,\" said Franden.\n\"If he goes to United it is because Mourinho has told him he will be the number one, the most important voice in the locker room.\n\"Zlatan wants to be the most important player on the pitch. He is not a leader in the way he talks, but he expects team-mates to listen to him especially when he is not happy. He is also extremely demanding of himself.\n\"He will be a good example to the young players in how disciplined he is and how hard he works. He is always early for training and one of the last to leave. He eats healthy and does not drink or smoke.\"\nFormer United assistant manager Rene Meulensteen told BBC Radio 5 live: \"In some ways Ibrahimovic is the perfect fit for Manchester United at this moment in time. They have young players in the dressing room and he is a leader, a winner.\n\"He would bring a lot to the club and really put United back to winning ways\"\nIbrahimovic is joining United to link back up with Mourinho, who coached him at Inter Milan for a season from 2008-09.\n\"From being a cat, I felt like a lion,\" was how Ibrahimovic described the impact of Mourinho in an interview with Radio 5 live.\n\"He was amazing. He dragged out of me things that no other coach has done before. When I played I felt like a Terminator, I felt so confident under him.\"\nIn his book I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic, he described Mourinho as a manager he was \"willing to die for\".\n\"The first time he met my partner Helena, he whispered to her: 'Helena, you have only one mission: feed Zlatan, let him sleep, keep him happy'.\"\n\"Mourinho knows what he is bringing. Zlatan has always wanted to work with him again,\" said Franden.\n\"He had been very eager and was disappointed Mourinho had not got him in before.\n\"He said at Inter that Mourinho was the best he had worked with and was disappointed Mourinho has, until now, not picked up the phone to ask him to come. Mourinho has always praised Zlatan.\n\"When Zlatan left Inter some players said they were two seconds away from getting physical with each other. There was not enough air to breathe but Zlatan is willing to work with him. They are two big egos and they do clash.\"\n\"If Mourinho lights up a room, Guardiola draws the curtains,\" wrote Ibahimovic about former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola, who takes over at Manchester City next season.\nHe referred to the Spaniard as a \"spineless coward\" in his autobiography, and Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed Ibrahimovic said he \"might punch Pep\" during his time at Barcelona.\nBarcelona bought Ibrahimovic for \u00a357m and he scored 21 goals in 51 matches, but he felt he was used incorrectly by Guardiola and once confronted him on the training ground over lack of playing time.\n\"I said I was being used in the wrong way and that they shouldn't have bought me if they wanted another type of player,\" he wrote about a meeting with Guardiola.\n\"I told him what a friend had said to me: 'You bought a Ferrari but drive it like a Fiat.'\"\nExpect fireworks at the Manchester derby next season.\nFormer team-mate Peter Schmeichel said Ibrahimovic could have the same affect at Old Trafford as Eric Cantona, the iconic French striker.\n\"United need inspirational players, players that stand alone,\" said the former Denmark keeper.\n\"We had Cantona in the mid-90s. A lot of what happened in the 1990s would not have happened without him. Now it is time to have someone like that again. Zlatan fits that bill.\n\"In the last five years Zlatan has only improved his fitness, his abilities and output . His stats are unbelievable. Not just say in the French league, because he does it in Europe and for Sweden. He finds the goals, he finds the tricks, he finds what the crowd needs. I said this before, he was born to play for United.\"\nEx-United midfielder Paul Scholes added: \"Zlatan joining United does excite me. I know it might only be one or two years at the most, but he is a fit lad, looks after himself and is a great character, he could pull it off without a shadow of a doubt.\"\nBrazil left-back Maxwell and Ibrahimovic first met at Ajax in 2001 and have followed each other to Inter Milan, Barcelona and Paris St-Germain. They are close friends.\nThe pair have won 10 league titles together, so could we see Maxwell join his friend across the English Channel?\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",

    "document": "But VR can also be embedded in reality to give people more understanding of the world around them.\nIncreasingly it is being used as a tool by journalists, teachers, healthcare workers and retailers.\nThe BBC took a look at a few of the more unexpected uses of the technology.\nSurveys suggest that while 99% of people have heard of autism, only 16% really understand what it means. In the UK, more than a quarter of autistic people have been asked to leave a public place, such as a restaurant.\nIn order to address this, the UK's National Autistic Society made a VR film this summer to show people what it was like to live with the condition.\nThe film takes viewers on a journey with a young, autistic boy as he walks around a shopping centre. They can experience the sensory overload he experiences as he walks around.\nMark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society, says he hopes the film will \"help the public understand a little more about autism\".\nThe film, along with Samsung Gear headsets, was taken on tour around UK shopping centres this summer and the charity is also putting together a pack for schools to teach their students about autism.\nThe film is available via an app and can be viewed on YouTube.\nAlzheimer's Research UK also released a VR film this summer, intended to put the public in the shoes of someone with dementia.\nA Walk Through Dementia aimed to show how everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea can be a challenge for someone with the condition.\nVirtual meatballs\nVirtual reality is becoming a common tool for people wanting to sell something. Estate agents use it to offer customers virtual walks from potential properties while Westfield shopping centre is using VR headsets to show off the latest fashion collections.\nIn April, furniture retailer Ikea launched an app that placed users in a fully furnished kitchen. Users could change the colours of the units and walk around the space. The app was available through Steam, using the HTC Vive.\nGamers are, said Ikea's Ingrid Franov, \"not a typical Ikea customer\" but the retailer was amazed by the reaction.\n\"In one month we had more downloads than we had expected for the whole six-months trial and people were asking for more kitchen action,\" she told delegates at the recent VR&AR World Forum in London.\n\"And what they wanted was meatball,\" she said.\nMeatballs are perhaps the most famous dish in Ikea's restaurants.\nWhen meatballs were added to the kitchen, one user told the firm: \"I want you all to know that I have just spent 44 minutes throwing meatballs around a virtual kitchen and I loved every second of it.\"\n\"This is really talking to customers,\" said Ms Franov.\nNow the retailer is considering rolling out the VR tool in stores to help customers better envisage how a kitchen design might look.\nHealthcare has become one of the big adopters of VR - using it both as  teaching aid and to treat phobias.\nSurgeon Dr Shafi Ahmed became one of the first to offer a live virtual surgery experience in April 2016 at the Royal London hospital.\nSome 5,000 people in 14 countries tuned in to watch the operation to remove a tumour.\nNow the start-up he co-founded, Medical Realities, is launching Virtual Surgeon as a product, hoping that such surgery can reduce the cost of training doctors, reach a much wider audience and ultimately \"democratise medicine\".\nMeanwhile, in the US, VR has been used to help soldiers deal with post-traumatic stress disorder and for arachnophobics to overcome their fear of spiders.\nIn one study, 23 people were encouraged to approach a virtual spider and by the end of the experiment, 83% showed significant improvement in how they could tolerate the situation.\nIn September 2015, Google launched Expeditions, a program designed to take thousands of school children around the world on a virtual trip - from the Great Barrier Reef to Mars.\nThe kit, which comprises a Google cardboard headset and an app, has just been launched in the UK.\nMost pupils have enjoyed the experience although one Year 3 student told the Times Educational Supplement that they \"were a bit scared of heights so if it could just be on the ground then that would be an improvement for me\".\nMarcus Storm is the founder of  VR start-up Evanescent Studios and he is developing a VR app that he hopes will be used in classrooms to improve language skills. The app is currently being trialled at Imperial College, with Mandarin as a pilot language.\nUsers can watch Chinese people having conversations and visit Chinese landmarks such as the Great Wall.\nMr Storm is enthusiastic about how VR can transform learning.\n\"We see a future where kids in history lessons are going back to revolutionary France and interacting with the people there,\" he said.\nIt is a view echoed by Nicholas Minter-Green, president of Economist Films.\n\"It is bringing the joy to education. The biggest challenge has always been to engage and that is where VR can be a very powerful tool,\" he said.\nAt VR&AR World Forum in London, he spoke about how Chinese firm NetDragon is testing how VR software and hardware can be used to tell if children are engaged in learning.\n\"One idea is that headsets could tell when children are tilting their heads, indicating boredom, meaning a change of subject or teaching method is required,\" he said.\nCash-strapped schools may struggle to afford the hardware or the computing power required for VR to run, and Mr Minter-Green acknowledged that there are many hurdles to overcome before virtual becomes a reality, in school at least.",

As Gary Warren tried to shepherd the ball out, Esson came flying out and inexplicably took the substitute down.\nReferee Andrew Dallas did not point to the spot, leaving Hamilton players in disbelief. It was a huge escape for the home side.\nHaving offered little earlier in the match, other than a great chance for Darian MacKinnon which he prodded wide, the second-half response was firm.\nDougie Imrie, Crawford and Greg Docherty all came close but ultimately they did not threaten enough and gave themselves too much to do after leaving themselves repeatedly exposed in defence.\nRedmond's late finish was little consolation, although the goal may yet have an important part to play in the final make-up of goal difference with so few points separating the sides.\nMatch ends, Inverness CT 2, Hamilton Academical 1.\nSecond Half ends, Inverness CT 2, Hamilton Academical 1.\nGoal!

Every saw miller tells me he would double or treble production if the timber was there to feed that mill,\" he added.",

We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough.\n\"The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character.\n\"Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation.\n\"After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration.

The picture shows the children dressed up in costumes for a fancy dress ball hosted by the Mayor and Mayoress of Bootle, Alderman and Mrs Howard.\nAs well as showing children at play, another image reminds us that many youngsters were also sent out to work.\nA nervous looking young maid for a well-to-do Liverpool family is captured in a great portrait which is thought to have been taken about 1900.\nThe exhibition has been put together by Kay Jones, Curator of Urban Community History at the Museum of Liverpool.\nMs Jones painstakingly trawled through hundreds of images from the National Museums Liverpool's collections before deciding on the final 25 for the exhibition.\nShe said: \"This has been a fascinating exhibition to work on.\n\"Looking through hundreds of different postcards, photographs and glass plate negatives in our collections; it was hard to decide on the final 25 images.\n\"I chose the ones that really stood out and told the experience of childhood.\n\"People love seeing old photographs and most people can relate to the same experiences of playing out in the street if they're from Liverpool or anywhere else.\n\"But, at the same time, the pictures also remind us of how things have changed.\n\"I didn't want it to be just happy memories, I also wanted to remember the children who had to work throughout their childhood.\n\"I wanted it to be the good and bad experiences of childhood.\"\nGrowing Up in the City is at the Museum of Liverpool until 25 September.",

I've now given up hope of becoming the next leader of UKIP.\"\nMs Evans said she had questioned whether to stay on in a party that \"allows, and arguably encourages senior figures to behave like this\", but she said the support from members had made her \"more determined ever not to give up on UKIP\".\nShe also said that with the right leader, the \"sky was the limit for the party\".\nEndorsing Lisa Duffy, a district councillor for Ramsey in Cambridgeshire, Ms Evans said she was \"the best chance\" UKIP had to \"change, to grow and to thrive\".\nShe said UKIP needed \"a clean break from the past\" to become more like a political party than \"just a rugby club on tour\".\nUnder Ms Duffy's leadership, she argued, the party would be \"more united and consensual\".\nPrior to her suspension Ms Evans wrote UKIP's 2015 general election manifesto. She was axed from her policy role in the party in-fighting which followed Mr Farage's \"unresignation\" after the general election.\nMr Farage has denied her ban was due to criticism of him.",

    "document": "Ashya was being treated in hospital in Southampton when his parents took him abroad without telling staff last year.\nThey ignored medical advice and took him to Prague for proton beam therapy.\nIt was later revealed Ashya did not receive subsequent chemotherapy in Prague, a move the team in Southampton say could jeopardise his recovery.\nSpeaking exclusively to the BBC, Dr Peter Wilson, paediatric intensive care consultant at Southampton General Hospital, said: \"We are unsure as to exactly what treatment he is receiving but what we do know is... every month that goes by that he's not getting chemotherapy, his outcome worsens.\n\"There are experts in the country that have already quoted figures of halving survival - so survival going from 80% to 40% or 50%, which is quite dramatic.\"\nThe Kings' version of events last year sparked a public outcry and staff members in Southampton said they received angry emails, letters and phone calls which, at one stage, forced the hospital to shut its switchboard.\nThe King family, who in March said five-year-old Ashya was now cancer free, declined to be interviewed as part of the BBC programme.\nIn March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Brett King told a national newspaper a recent scan showed \"no evidence\" of the tumour.\nBut cancer experts have told the BBC although it appears Ashya is in remission it is far too early to say he has been completely cured.\nOncology specialist Professor Karol Sikora said: \"Ashya is not completely out of the woods yet, but 78% of children with this type of rare cancer actually survive and are cured.\n\"The fact he is disease free at this point is great, but it doesn't mean he is cured yet.\"\nThe breakdown in the relationship between Brett King and the hospital stemmed from his belief that Ashya should not receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy following surgery to remove a brain tumour.\nMr King claimed in a YouTube video that staff threatened him with a court order if he refused Ashya's treatment, something the hospital has denied.\nHe told journalists in Spain after his arrest: \"They were going to kill him in England or turn him into a vegetable.\"\nThrough the media, the King family raised tens of thousands of pounds for Ashya's treatment before the NHS agreed to pay for proton therapy in Prague.\nDr Nicky Thorp, of the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group of paediatricians, said: \"We were dismayed, but on reflection I can see why NHS England agreed to fund that child's case. The child was there, the child needed radiotherapy.\n\"The use of protons does not improve cure rates of tumours... and it saddens me to see the way the truth can be twisted and misunderstood.\"\nIn Prague, Ashya's parents refused the chemotherapy, which had been recommended by doctors and ordered by the High Court.\nBut in March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Mr King said his son was cancer free.\nPaediatric oncology consultant Dr Ramya Ramanujachar, who was involved in Ashya's treatment, warned the case could set a worrying precedent.\nShe said: \"I don't think the parents can look after their own child with a brain tumour and be not only the carers but also the professionals directing, managing and dictating their child's treatment.\"\nDr Wilson said the case had led to an \"impossible situation\" for clinicians faced with families in the same situation.\n\"That is deeply unfair when the NHS is always supposed to be about equal healthcare for all,\" he added.\nAshya: The Untold Story is to be broadcast on BBC1 in the South region on Friday at 19:30 BST.",

I knew it would be a long race to the end\nButton climbed up from sixth on the grid to pass Vettel at the second pit stops but was re-passed with two laps to go.\nHowever, the Englishman was promoted to second place after race stewards gave Vettel a 20-second penalty for his overtake of Button on the penultimate lap.\nLewis Hamilton retired with gearbox damage after running well down the field following an early puncture. But he will not incur any penalty for a gearbox change because of his retirement.\nThe result extends Alonso's championship lead to 34 points ahead of Red Bull's Mark Webber who had a low-key race to eighth place, never showing any real pace.\nAlonso said: \"It was tough, not an easy race. Maybe we were not the quickest in dry conditions but we were competitive and it was enough to maintain the lead.\n\"Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops. I knew it would be a long race to the end, with Jenson putting pressure.\n\"But the car was feeling good on top speed and traction and that was enough to keep the lead into Turn 6, and after that overtaking is not so easy.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe only consolation for Hamilton on the occasion of his 100th grand prix was that the McLaren showed encouraging pace following a major performance upgrade.\nAt one stage, Hamilton unlapped himself on Vettel - although not Alonso - as he attempted vainly to recover from his early set-back. A move which angered the double world champion.\nAlonso was never very far in front but was always able to stay just far enough ahead of first Vettel and then Button to ensure they could not use their DRS overtaking aids to pass him into the hairpin at Turn 6.\nIt led to a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag.\nThe Ferrari made a lightning start from pole position and although Vettel quickly closed up the initial gap Alonso had built on the first lap, the Spaniard was able to pull clear before their first pit stops to ensure he held the lead into the second stint.\nMeanwhile, Button was fighting past Hulkenberg and then Schumacher, to move quietly into third place.\nVettel emerged from his first pit stop five seconds ahead of Button but the McLaren closed remorselessly on the Red Bull and passed the German by making his second stop a lap earlier.\nVettel emerged from the pits to find Button on his outside on the run to Turn 2, and the McLaren easily took the position.\nButton was rarely more than a second behind Alonso from then until the end of the race but the Ferrari driver was always in control and in the closing laps he stretched away as Button began to lose grip in his rear tyres.\nRather than try to take the lead, Button had to spend the closing laps fighting off a late challenge from Vettel, who passed him at the Turn 6 hairpin on the penultimate lap.\nVettel said: \"The pace was there but it was extremely difficult when I was close to Fernando and Jenson we seemed to lose a lot and not be able to stay close enough to try to something under braking.\n\"I am not entirely happy, it could have been a bit better if it was clean air most of the race but that was not the case. Second place was the best we could get today and I am happy with that.\"\nButton said: \"It was a close race and I couldn't quite get Fernando at the end.\n\"When you are in the middle of three you really have to fight and I was pushing a little bit more in the early part of the stint, whereas when you're in front you can coast a bit in the bits where you don't need to push.\n\"It was close but Fernando knows as we all do where to use Kers to keep someone behind you. I ran out of steam at the end of the straight and the gap was a little bit too big to get back.\n\"But it was a fun race and it's nice to be on the podium again.

They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out.\nWhile Apple had offered the two-step verification system in the past, until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm's back-up service.\nThat meant that even if people had switched on the two-step feature to prevent cyber-thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password, the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker.\nSeveral hackers' forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of Elcomsoft's \"forensic\" software, which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access iCloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect's iPhone or iPad.\nElmcomSoft's Moscow-based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks, as it was \"the only one able to do that\".\nHe has now acknowledged that Apple's changes guard against the technique he had used.\n\"I think that implementation is secure, and so there is no workaround,\" Vladimir Katalov told the BBC, adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-ups linked to a user's account.\n\"The other security improvement, which I like, is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-factor authentication is enabled.\"\nHowever, he added that he still had concerns about Apple's security system.\n\"The recovery key is hard to remember. And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it,\" he said.\n\"And if you lose your device too, there will be no way to get your data back.\n\"Secondly, the recovery key might be stolen. And someone who managed to get your Apple ID password and your security key could make a lot of trouble for you, not just downloading your selfies.\"\nBut another security expert downplayed the risk of lost recovery keys, and said that Apple should do more than just recommend people switch on the two-factor test.\n\"We've seen so much in recent times that single-step verification - ie passwords - is vulnerable, we're at the stage that two-factor authentication should be the default,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.\n\"It's a case of turn it on by default, and let people turn it off if they really don't want it.\n\"And that applies to not just Apple, but companies like Microsoft and Google too.\"\nApple has told the Wall Street Journal that it \"plans to more aggressively encourage people\" to turn two-factor authentication on and use stronger passwords.\n\"When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece,\" chief executive Tim Cook told the newspaper.\n\"I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up.

Members will submit a report to parliament, before the order is voted on by all MSPs at a later date.\nPutting forward a motion to have the committee recommend the move to parliament, Mr Mackay told its members that his plans would lead to a \"more progressive\" and \"fairer\" system of local taxation.\nMr Wightman lodged an amendment to the finance secretary's motion to \"note concerns\" about the fact the council tax base has not been updated since 1991 and recognising the recommendation of the Commission on Local Tax Reform that \"the present council tax system must end\".\nLabour's Elaine Smith backed Mr Wightman, saying the committee should \"reflect the evidence\" heard from members.\nBut SNP and Conservative members united against the amendment, with Tory Graham Simpson saying there \"isn't much point\" to adding it to the debate.\nMr Simpson also opposed Mr Mackay's original motion, saying it represented a \"fundamental change\" to the way local services are funded, and undermined local accountability.\nThe motion ultimately passed by four votes to two, with Ms Smith joining the three SNP members and Mr Wightman abstaining.\nThe committee will now compile a report on the issue for parliament, while it will be down to the parliamentary bureau to decide if there needs to be a further chamber debate on the issue as well as a vote.\nThe government was only saved from a chamber defeat over council tax in September when Labour leader Kezia Dugdale's vote failed to register.\nOpposition members had successfully amended a government motion promoting its council tax reform strategy, changing the wording to condemn the approach as undermining local accountability. But the final vote on the amended motion was tied after Ms Dugdale's vote was not counted.\nMr Wightman had also called for a revaluation of council tax bands during the committee debate, pointing out that the current bands were based on property values dating back to 1991.\nThe Green MSP said he had a constituent whose flat was in band E, but was worth \u00a320,000 less than neighbouring flats in band B.\nLabour's Elaine Smith pointed out that some council tax payers weren't even born when the council tax values of their properties were determined.\nMr Mackay said a \"costly\" revaluation would \"take time\" and could be a \"shock\" to many households - with some potentially facing \"astronomically high\" tax increases under a full revaluation.\nBut he said the changes to bands were \"not the end of the story in terms of local tax [reform]\", saying the government was taking a \"balanced approach\" while seeking to \"make council tax more progressive\".\nThe Scottish government has started the process of reforming local taxation following on from the Commission on Local Tax Reform, which called for a fairer, more transparent and progressive tax to fund local services.\nOpposition members have accused the government of \"tinkering\" with the system rather than making bold reforms.\nThe Scottish Conservatives support an end to the council tax freeze and increases to the top two bands, but oppose the changes to bands E and F.\nBut Labour and the Greens both want to see the \"hated\" council tax scrapped, with Labour repeatedly accusing the SNP of abandoning an earlier promise to do so.",

yet cannot provide details. \"If we tell the terrorists every way that we're going to track them, they will get through and Americans will die,\" he said\nSome experts question its true powers, with digital forensics professor Peter Sommer telling the BBC the access may be more akin to a \"catflap\" than a \"backdoor\".\n\"The spooks may be allowed to use these firms' servers but only in respect of a named target,\" he said.\n\"Or they may get a court order and the firm will provide them with material on a hard-drive or similar.\"\nWhat about data-protection laws?\nDifferent countries have different laws regarding data protection, but these tend to aim to regulate what data companies can hold about their customers, what they can do with it and how long they can keep it for - rather than government activity.\nMost individual company privacy policies will include a clause suggesting they will share information if legally obliged - and include careful wording about other monitoring.\nFacebook's privacy policy, for example, states: \" We use the information [uploaded by users] to prevent potentially illegal activities\".\nAre we all being watched?\nThe ways in which individual governments monitor citizen activity is notoriously secretive in the interests of national security, and officials generally argue that preventing terrorism over-rides protecting privacy.\n\"You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,\" said US President Barack Obama, defending US surveillance tactics.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that phone records were only accessed by the NSA in cases where there was reason to suspect an individual was connected with al-Qaeda or Iran.\nSpeaking to the BBC UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said that \"law abiding citizens\" in Britain would \"never be aware of all the things... agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen or to stop a terrorist blowing you up\".\nDoes it make a difference which country you live in?\nUser data (such as emails and social media activity) is often not stored in the same country as the users themselves - Facebook for example has a clause in its privacy policy saying that all users must consent to their data being \"transferred to and stored in\" the US.\nThe US Patriot Act of 2001 gave American authorities new powers over European data stored in this way.\nThis method of storage is part of cloud computing, in which both storage and processing is carried out away from the individual's own PC.\n\"Most cloud providers, and certainly the market leaders, fall within the US jurisdiction either because they are US companies or conduct systematic business in the US,\" Axel Arnbak, a researcher at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Information Law, told CBS News last year after conducting a study into cloud computing, higher education and the act.\n\"In particular, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments (FISA) Act makes it easy for US authorities to circumvent local government institutions and mandate direct and easy access to cloud data belonging to non-Americans living outside the US, with little or no transparency obligations for such practices - not even the number of actual requests.\"\nAre other governments involved?\nUK Foreign Secretary William Hague has so far refused to confirm or deny whether British government surveillance department GCHQ has had access to Prism.\nIt is not known whether other governments around the world have been either aware of or involved in the use of Prism, which is reported to have been established in 2007.\nIn a statement, the EU Justice Commission said it was \"concerned\" about the consequences of Prism for EU citizens and was \"seeking more details\" from the US authorities.\n\"Where the rights of an EU citizen in a Member State are concerned, it is for a national judge to determine whether data can be lawfully transmitted in accordance with legal requirements (be they national, EU or international),\" said a spokesperson for Justice Commissioner Vivane Reding.\nWhat does this mean for internet use?\nWilliam Hague insists that law-abiding citizens have nothing to worry about, and there is no legal way of \"opting out\" of monitoring activity carried out in the name of national or global security.\nHowever privacy concerns about information uploaded to the internet have been around for almost as long as the internet itself, and campaign group Privacy International says the reported existence of Prism confirms its \"worst fears and suspicions\".\n\"Since many of the world's leading technology companies are based in the US, essentially anyone who participates in our interconnected world and uses popular services like Google or Skype can have their privacy violated through the Prism programme,\" says  Privacy International on its website.\n\"The US government can have access to much of the world's data, by default, with no recourse.\"\nEdward Snowden, the source of the leaked documents, said he had acted over concerns about privacy.\n\"I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,\" he told the Guardian.",

The impact was minimal and we were, along with our Caf colleagues, able to make it pass.\"\nMorocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began.\nThe North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead.\nEarlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (\u00a3675,000) to $50,000 (\u00a334,000).\nEquatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare.\nThe host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over.\n\"I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems,\" FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport.\nSeeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty.\nThe spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared.\nThe Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup.\nContrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption.\n\"We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence,\" said Snoussi.\n\"But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium.\"\n\"But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. \"We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected.\n\"In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match.\"\nTunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement.\n\"Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page,\" said Snoussi.\n\"We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out.\"\nFollowing last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F.\nShould the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.",

One can use the experience of previous students to benefit future students. An interesting fact is that the data of the interactions before the course actually starts, like reading the material available and engaging with forums, is extremely valuable.\n\"Currently it is deployed on 13 modules, mostly level one modules in order to try to provide timely indicators that students may be struggling.\n\"The model is tailored to each of the modules and by using this and identifying students, more tailored support may be provided.\"\nThe OU has taken steps to ensure that students' privacy is not compromised by the scheme - putting in place an ethics policy, agreed in consultation with a student committee, to protect their data.\nRuth Tudor, president of the Open University's Students' Association, thinks the scheme is a positive one.\n\"It's a great idea and a great way of providing targeted support to students who may be struggling and need extra help,\" she told the BBC.\n\"I would like to think that this would improve the drop-out rate from OU courses. You must remember they take students who have come from no academic background so it is always possible that those people take on more than they think they can manage.\n\"That's why data analytics will help provide extra support and can help them be successful.\"\nReports suggest that some other British universities are thinking of using similar methods and Ms Tudor added: \"I don't see why this shouldn't happen in other universities. It has happened in the USA and I'm surprised they're not using it here.\"",

    "document": "Imran Khawaja tried to sneak back into the UK last year - and while his exact activity in Syria remains a mystery, police say he is one of the most dangerous British jihadists to return from conflict.\nHe was one of the most public British fighters in Syria - always online, but always masked.\nBut now, Imran Khawaja, 27, from Southall, west London is facing a possible prison term up to life imprisonment for his role in life and death on Syria's battlefields.\nKhawaja left the UK last January. He called himself Abu Daigham al-Britani. And after reaching the warzone via Kurdish territory, he began posting videos and pictures of his personal jihad.\nIn one video he explains how a fellow fighter was shot through the side - but \"thanks to Allah's will\" was soon back on the front line. In another - masked again - he is showing off his amateur weight-lifting skills as his brothers-in-arms cheer him on.\nKhawaja was a member of Rayat al Tawheed - which means Flag of Unity. The group of fighters affiliated to Islamic State includes many British men, and they have spent more than a year selling a message to their supporters and would-be recruits back home.\nKhawaja was involved in appeals for donations, video diaries of their lives  and \"through the keyhole\" tours of fighters' quarters.\nShiraz Maher, of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR), at Kings College London, has been tracking foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq.\nHe says: \"The group that Khawaja was with in Syria was really quite dynamic,\" he says. \"They clearly had people with programming skills - they were able to put together very slick, well produced propaganda videos and posters that appealed to young British Muslims.\n\"They were able to play on the same cultural anchors and mores that those people recognised and know. They could speak to them as peers.\n\"Rayat al Tawheed helped a great deal in the early stages of this conflict with portraying the idea of volunteering as a jihadist as quite a glamorous adventurous thing - and a noble thing.\"\nBut Rayat's war was neither noble nor glamorous. Some of its material online showed gruesome scenes of death. One image showed a man's bloodied-hands with the caption \"my first time\".\nAnd another shocking image included Imran Khawaja. In this gruesome picture, the Londoner - masked yet again - is holding a bag that contains a head.\nThe only thing we know about the victim is that he was supposedly a Syrian army soldier. But we do know that the British security service MI5 was watching - and waiting.\nAnd last June, its opportunity came.\nImran Khawaja decided to come home. It's not clear why because he hasn't told the police.\nHis cousin Tahir Bhatti, a taxi driver from Watford, agreed to help him return because the family wanted him back safely. Khawaja's own intentions are unclear. He had originally asked his cousin for money for a new gun - something Bhatti did not help him with. And then the fighter began trying to cover his tracks.\nAs Bhatti, who has admitted assisting an offender, drove to Bulgaria to pick him up, Khawaja faked his own death with an online obituary that said he had died in battle. The announcement asked that Allah grant him the highest position in heaven. He then tried to slip back into Britain unnoticed.\nAs the pair arrived at Dover, the police were waiting - and they ended up facing prosecution at the Old Bailey.\nCdr Richard Walton, the head of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command, says: \"Imran Khawaja is not a vulnerable teenager who has been enticed to travel to Syria.\n\"This is a man who chosen the path of terrorism, who has chosen to go out to Syria to be trained and engage in a terrorist training camp.\n\"We don't know why he came back, we don't know what he was planning - but we know he concealed his entry and faked his own death. This is a dangerous man.\"\nImran Khawaja was considered so dangerous that while he was on remand, he was held in the special unit for high risk terrorism suspects at London's maximum security Belmarsh prison.\nHe has admitted four offences:\nTahir Bhatti has pleaded guilty to assisting an offender.\nKhawaja had originally faced an additional charge of soliciting to murder. That allegation, the most serious to be made yet against a Syrian fighter, will lie on file.",

I was always the Wales goalkeeper.\n\"It kept us sane, it was a bit of normality, but it sounds wrong somehow to say I've got fond memories of playing football, considering what was going on just over the fence.\"\nHe says as well as keeping up spirits, football played a major role in his survival, and that of many of his fellow prisoners, when they were forced on one of the series of extremely long marches westwards from PoW camps during the final stages of the conflict.\nWhilst many of Mr Jones's friends died on the march, he believes it is no coincidence that those who had been involved in the Auschwitz football league fared better.\n\"You could say the football we'd played saved our lives. The football lads were fitter, yes, but more than that, they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march.\"\nE715 was located close to Auschwitz III, Monowitz, which held mainly Polish resistance fighters, political dissidents, homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops.\nWhilst this was not officially a death camp, Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Monowitz were far from safe.\n\"In the nights you could hear shots coming from Monowitz,\" he said.\n\"Not bursts like you had when you were fighting, but deliberate, regular every few seconds; like they had a system going.\n\"We didn't know who they were or why they'd been killed, and we couldn't help but be terrified that we'd be next.\"\nBut when the British PoWs were allowed out to play football, they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II, Birkenau, where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale.\n\"The first Sunday we went to the playing fields, we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches,\" he said.\n\"We asked, 'Who are those poor sods?' and the German guards shout 'Juden', Jews, as if it had been a stupid question.\n\"We could only play in the summer, because everything was covered in snow through the winter. But when it was hot, this awful stench would waft across from the crematoriums.\n\"Your imaginations pretty much filled in the gaps for you, but we'd carry on playing football.\n\"Scoring a goal, making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up.\"\nMr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birkenau.\n\"You have to remember that our guards weren't SS like in Birkenau; they were conscripted squaddies like us,\" he said.\n\"Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us, and if you got them on their own, you could tell that they were ordinary, decent blokes.\n\"But if you asked them about Birkenau they'd get angry and scared. 'We didn't need to know', 'they didn't know', 'it was nothing', and even if it was, then 'it wasn't their fault, they weren't SS'.\"\n\"I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war, but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through.\n\"Some would say they deserve it, but most likely they couldn't have done any more about it than we could have ourselves.\"\nAs the Red Army closed in, on 21 January, 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones's hut in the middle of the night, and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry.\nThe Soviets liberated Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945, confirming for the first time the stories of the Holocaust's mass murder, which the Allies had hitherto rubbished as too extreme to be possible.\nBut by the time the Russians arrived, Mr Jones was long gone; as part of the death march west, which killed anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 Allied PoWs.\n\"We were on the road for 17 weeks, and God knows how many hundreds of miles we traipsed, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria.\"\n\"I was 13 stone (82kg) when I was captured, and when I was liberated by the Americans in April 1945, they weighed me, and I was seven stone.\"\nMr Jones considers himself one of the lucky ones.\n\"I was very lucky. I came home to a good wife, who helped me get over it. But lots never really recovered at all,\" he said.\n\"I think I'm probably the last now. There was another of the footballers who I got Christmas cards from, but there was nothing this year. So at 94, I think it's probably time to tell the story before it's too late.\"",

I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence.
